It was a technique designed by Ōnoki to protect the village from attackers while lowering the number of casualties.\n\n## Notes\n- They are able to phase through the earthen ground for travel and drag their enemies with them, as well as extend their limbs.\n- While they have no fear, they have a limited lifespan and intelligence, being capable of obeying instructions and communicating with fabrications.\n- Their masks are their weakness, the destruction of which would lead to their deaths.\n- While deemed to have no will, this was proven false in Akkun's existence, a small Akuta who gained affection to Inojin Yamanaka, and even defied its comrades to protect him.\n- Kirara deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits.\n- When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against Ōnoki's orders.\n- When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led Kurotsuchi to reject the technique's further development.\n- Despite this, Ōnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.\n- Iwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced.\n- It was later destroyed by Konohamaru Sarutobi.\n"

Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\n\n## Usage\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.\n- With the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.\n- * Despite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.\n\n## Notes\n- The first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust.\n- Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills.\n- Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\n"

The dragon itself is capable of flight, and, while Deidara is safely on its back, the dragon can spit out smaller clay figures that attack the opponent like guided missiles.\n\n## Notes\n- These independent missile-like creatures take the form of a greatly reduced version of the larger dragon that created them, however, despite this decrease in size they are still relatively larger than a normal person.\n- Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail.\n- This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings.\n- By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\n- The dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space.\n- This is achieved through the use of Tobi's Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique, to hide a large amount of these mines underground, without the opponents' knowledge to their exact location.\n- When this tactic is combined with the previously mentioned missiles, it can confine the enemies' movements to such an extent, that they are forced to suffer an explosion.\n- * According to Tobi, this is Deidara's favourite technique involving explosive clay.\n"

One method of doing this is for the user to convert chakra in their body into an earthen material that they spit from their mouth; the more skilled the user, the greater the volume of earth that can be created.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Although the muddy material is solid on its own, it is further fortified with a coat of chakra, making it more resistant to fire and water than it would otherwise be.\n\n## Notes\n- The earth quickly piles up into a defensive wall, blocking incoming attacks.\n- Walls erected in this way are typically featureless, but users can alter the appearance if they choose; Kakashi Hatake adorns his with bulldog sculptures.\n- Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.\n- The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.\n- In Kakashi Retsuden , the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the Fourth Shinobi World War, to make up for the loss of his Sharingan.\n- His improved Earth-Style Wall is large enough to surround a small village, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannons, and he can remotely repair any damage it receives.\n- Kakashi is able to maintain such a wall for over a day by himself, something most onlookers believe would require the work of team.\n"

Kazuma described it as the ultimate Earth element resurrection technique.\n\n## Usage\n- The first version allows the user to seemingly continuously resurrect a large number of slain people as zombies, but with none of their rationality, physical prowess, or techniques at their disposal.\n- The second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- At any time, by performing a Snake hand seal and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.\n\n## Notes\n- They are fairly easy to destroy.\n- If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.\n- Unlike the Impure World Reincarnation technique, the soul is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed.\n- This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e.\n- electricity).\n"

In order to pursue this view, as well as to apply it towards combat, Deidara feeds clay to one of his body's mouths – most commonly the mouth on his left palm – giving them shape and turning them into explosives.\n\n## Usage\n- This in turn brings the clay creation to life, which Deidara can control remotely depending on how large it was made: an average-sized bird can be sent flying at an opponent as an attack; a large bird can be used as a form of transportation, and once he reaches his destination he can send it flying at an opponent as an attack.\n- The dragon also produces clay mines, which are used to force opponents to fight in a limited space.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- To detonate the clay, he makes the Seal of Confrontation and says .\n\n## Notes\n- The power and type of explosion is determined by the chakra that he applies to the clay.\n- To make practical use of them, however, it is necessary that Deidara enlarge them.\n- Low chakra reserves also place Deidara at a disadvantage, as his mouths will struggle to shape the clay into usable forms.\n- Deidara's clay is all earth-based, meaning that opponents can defuse the explosives with Lightning Release.\n- They are usually kept at a small size, making them ideal for sneak attacks or other covert operations.\n- * C2 : a large, flight-capable dragon.\n- Deidara rides atop it while it fires \"smart bombs\", smaller dragons that pursue their targets.\n- * C3 : a roughly human-shaped statue that Deidara drops on targets from above.\n- They are designed to specifically maximise their destructive power, which is supposed to be great enough to destroy an entire village.\n- * C0 : Deidara's .\n- Deidara draws in chakra from every corner of his body to turn himself into a bomb.\n- Everything within ten kilometres is destroyed, but Deidara dies in the process.\n- C0 is created using the mouth on Deidara's chest, which is connected directly to his heart.\n- It is also used as a means of focusing energy.\n- ** In the English dub, Deidara's cry of \"katsu\" is omitted with a mere grunt instead.\n- * Naruto referred to the Explosive Clay as a kinjutsu of Iwagakure.\n"

Though only the size of a fist, each hides within it the power to obliterate an entire forest.\n\n## Usage\n- Acquisition method may determine the number, as both Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha gained ten orbs upon becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki; Obito initially only formed two, obtaining the other eight upon gaining control of the Ten-Tails' power.\n- In Naruto's case, the orbs currently under his control disappear and reappear alongside his chakra cloak, while the orbs he has discarded remain active.\n- However, the orbs are incapable of nullifying senjutsu, as according to Naruto, natural energy can be used to combat itself.\n- Whatever their shape, users can only control the orbs within 70 metres of their location, allowing opponents to disable them by transporting them elsewhere.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Obito was able to manifest a single Truth-Seeking Ball after absorbing some of Madara's power.\n- Obito on defensive.png|The Sword of Nunoboko (left hand) and a shield (right hand).\n- Madara Jinchuriki anime.png|Madara's shakujō.\n\n## Notes\n- whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo.\n- Entering Tenseigan Chakra Mode also grants the user Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- The number of Truth-Seeking Balls acquired varies from user to user.\n- Upon receiving power from Hagoromo, Naruto Uzumaki, instead gained nine orbs, while Asura Ōtsutsuki only showed five orbs, nine orbs in the anime.\n- Toneri Ōtsutsuki is depicted with an inconsistent amount.\n- and users cannot create additional orbs after the initial acquisition number; thus, orbs that are lost for whatever reason cannot be replaced.\n- Clones are not created with orbs of their own, though the user can temporarily transfer them to a clone.\n- Truth-Seeking Balls encompass the power of all five basic natures, and as such they surpass both kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.\n- If imbued with a certain Yin–Yang Release jutsu, the orbs can nullify any ninjutsu they touch and thus become impervious to it; this includes negating the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation, making it possible to permanently damage and kill those reincarnated by the technique.\n- Naruto can use Truth-Seeking Balls to create his Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.\n- Similarly, Obito was able to convert one of his orbs into black receivers, allowing him to use the Six Red Yang Formation.\n- While in their default sphere form, the orbs can be launched as high-speed projectiles, expanded to enormous sizes in an instant.\n- Because the high-density chakra is in a condensed state, it can be pulled and stretched into a smooth and flat consistency, as well as freely manipulated into any other shape.\n- though Obito does so by passing them through holes that temporarily form in his hands.\n- Though highly durable, this defence can still be broken by attacks that cannot be nullified, such as powerful senjutsu and taijutsu.\n- Gudōdama 1.png|Stretched around the user as a defence.\n- Gudōdama 2.png|A weapon with adjustable length and thickness, called a in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing .\n- Obito generates Receiver.png|Converted into black receivers.\n- Obito stops Naruto and Sasuke.png|Used similar to chakra arms.\n- Truth-Seeking Orb Platform.png|Reshaped to serve as a platform.\n- Obito Second Transformation.png|Obito's shakujō.\n- NTCM and SPSM.png|Naruto's .\n- Rather than simple black constructs, Toneri demonstrated the ability to transform one of these glowing orbs into an ornate golden cage.\n- He could also combine them to create a massive vortex capable of blasting through the moon's surface and a giant sword capable of cutting the entire moon in half.\n- * Despite stating that the orbs are wielded by Six Paths Senjutsu users, the fourth databook does not classify this technique as senjutsu.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and Jump Force , Truth-Seeking Balls give off a purple glow.\n- In the former, Obito employs the orbs in several unique ways, such as forming scythes, drills, spinning disks, hands capable of firing Tailed Beast Balls and blasts of chakra.\n- * Despite repeatedly accessing his orbs every time he entered Six Paths Sage Mode during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has not been seen accessing them since whenever using said form.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , Obito has a technique called , in which he combines his Truth-Seeking Balls into a single expanding orb that obliterates the surrounding area.\n- The technique refers to the Trailokya, the three realms of karmic rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.\n"
