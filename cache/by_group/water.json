Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\n\n## Usage\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.\n- With the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.\n- * Despite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.\n\n## Notes\n- The first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust.\n- Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills.\n- Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\n"

During this technique, the falling raindrops are closely linked to Pain's senses.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The rain will keep on falling until Pain uses the seal to cancel it.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The detection of the rain, however, is not specific as Pain can only know if someone has entered the vicinity of the rain but not where specifically they are.\n- When Pain is away from Amegakure, he always uses this technique to keep a close eye on the village.\n- It keeps a very close guard on its cubs, watches vigilantly for an opportunity to catch its prey, and walks great distances to patrol its territory; all a reference to how Pain uses this technique to vigilantly watch over the village.\n\n## Notes\n- When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected.\n- Upon knowing an intruder has entered the rain's vicinity, he needs someone who specialises in covering large areas to find the intruder's specific location.\n- He also made it rain every Sunday.\n- Assuming that no one in the village knows about the sensory nature of this technique apart from Nagato and Konan, outsiders will think the rain is a natural occurrence and will not be aware they will be detected once the raindrops fall upon them.\n"

Naruto and eight of his shadow clones each form a Rasenshuriken that's been imbued with the unique chakra of a different tailed beast; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra Kaguya Ōtsutsuki would be weak to.\n\n## Notes\n- Jin no Sho describes this as, \"the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time.\"\n\nThe exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:\n#The Rasenshuriken for Shukaku has a similar appearance to the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan, which uses magnetized sand.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Matatabi appears to consist of the same blue fire that Matatabi's body is composed of.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Isobu is seemingly formed out of water.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Son Gokū appears to be the Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Kokuō seems to be emitting steam, which Kokuō's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Saiken resembles a bubbly gas.\n- In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for Wisdom Wolf Decay.\n- In the anime, it appears more analogous to the Soap Bubble Ninjutsu used by Saiken's jinchūriki.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Chōmei has no obvious source in either the manga or anime.\n- Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 identifies it as being composed of Scale Powder.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Gyūki is seemingly made of ink, which Gyūki's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Kurama appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , both known variations of the Lava Release are implied to be present separately within this technique.\n"

The water in the clone is surrounded by a thin layer of oil and due to this structure, the clone's temperature can easily be altered from cold to hot and vice-versa.\n\n## Usage\n- This high-speed movement also allows it to heat up very quickly and to more easily inflict damage using an axe-like liquid blade that it is able to form on its arm.\n\n## Notes\n- When it exerts itself, the outer layer of oil heats up and evaporates the water inside.\n- As the internal pressure builds, the clone expands until it violently explodes and the water vapour is released.\n- The force of the explosion is great enough to completely destroy even durable constructs.\n- This vapour then cools down as it rises and as a result, turns into hail that cools the clone, causing it to shrink to its original size and start the entire process again.\n- Despite its constantly increasing size, the clone itself remains very fast throughout the technique, enough to elude even Gaara's chakra-infused sand.\n- Throughout the duration of this technique, the Mizukage becomes weakened and vulnerable.\n- * The continuous cycle of this attack is very similar to that of the water cycle.\n"

      "markdown": "# Truth-Seeking Ball\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Element/Type: Fire Release, Wind Release, Lightning Release, Earth Release, Water Release, Yin–Yang Release\n- Classification: Ninjutsu, Senjutsu,\n- Class: Offensive, Defensive, Supplementary\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Asura Ōtsutsuki, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Hamura Ōtsutsuki, Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, Naruto Uzumaki, Ten-Tails, Toneri Ōtsutsuki~movie canon\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie canon\n\n## Summary\nTruth-Seeking Balls are orbs of malleable black chakra, which can alter their form and characteristics in various ways. Though only the size of a fist, each hides within it the power to obliterate an entire forest.\n\n## Usage\n- Acquisition method may determine the number, as both Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha gained ten orbs upon becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki; Obito initially only formed two, obtaining the other eight upon gaining control of the Ten-Tails' power.\n- In Naruto's case, the orbs currently under his control disappear and reappear alongside his chakra cloak, while the orbs he has discarded remain active.\n- However, the orbs are incapable of nullifying senjutsu, as according to Naruto, natural energy can be used to combat itself.\n- Whatever their shape, users can only control the orbs within 70 metres of their location, allowing opponents to disable them by transporting them elsewhere.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Obito was able to manifest a single Truth-Seeking Ball after absorbing some of Madara's power.\n- Obito on defensive.png|The Sword of Nunoboko (left hand) and a shield (right hand).\n- Madara Jinchuriki anime.png|Madara's shakujō.\n\n## Notes\n- whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo.\n- Entering Tenseigan Chakra Mode also grants the user Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- The number of Truth-Seeking Balls acquired varies from user to user.\n- Upon receiving power from Hagoromo, Naruto Uzumaki, instead gained nine orbs, while Asura Ōtsutsuki only showed five orbs, nine orbs in the anime.\n- Toneri Ōtsutsuki is depicted with an inconsistent amount.\n- and users cannot create additional orbs after the initial acquisition number; thus, orbs that are lost for whatever reason cannot be replaced.\n- Clones are not created with orbs of their own, though the user can temporarily transfer them to a clone.\n- Truth-Seeking Balls encompass the power of all five basic natures, and as such they surpass both kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.\n- If imbued with a certain Yin–Yang Release jutsu, the orbs can nullify any ninjutsu they touch and thus become impervious to it; this includes negating the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation, making it possible to permanently damage and kill those reincarnated by the technique.\n- Naruto can use Truth-Seeking Balls to create his Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.\n- Similarly, Obito was able to convert one of his orbs into black receivers, allowing him to use the Six Red Yang Formation.\n- While in their default sphere form, the orbs can be launched as high-speed projectiles, expanded to enormous sizes in an instant.\n- Because the high-density chakra is in a condensed state, it can be pulled and stretched into a smooth and flat consistency, as well as freely manipulated into any other shape.\n- though Obito does so by passing them through holes that temporarily form in his hands.\n- Though highly durable, this defence can still be broken by attacks that cannot be nullified, such as powerful senjutsu and taijutsu.\n- Gudōdama 1.png|Stretched around the user as a defence.\n- Gudōdama 2.png|A weapon with adjustable length and thickness, called a in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing .\n- Obito generates Receiver.png|Converted into black receivers.\n- Obito stops Naruto and Sasuke.png|Used similar to chakra arms.\n- Truth-Seeking Orb Platform.png|Reshaped to serve as a platform.\n- Obito Second Transformation.png|Obito's shakujō.\n- NTCM and SPSM.png|Naruto's .\n- Rather than simple black constructs, Toneri demonstrated the ability to transform one of these glowing orbs into an ornate golden cage.\n- He could also combine them to create a massive vortex capable of blasting through the moon's surface and a giant sword capable of cutting the entire moon in half.\n- * Despite stating that the orbs are wielded by Six Paths Senjutsu users, the fourth databook does not classify this technique as senjutsu.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and Jump Force , Truth-Seeking Balls give off a purple glow.\n- In the former, Obito employs the orbs in several unique ways, such as forming scythes, drills, spinning disks, hands capable of firing Tailed Beast Balls and blasts of chakra.\n- * Despite repeatedly accessing his orbs every time he entered Six Paths Sage Mode during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has not been seen accessing them since whenever using said form.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , Obito has a technique called , in which he combines his Truth-Seeking Balls into a single expanding orb that obliterates the surrounding area.\n- The technique refers to the Trailokya, the three realms of karmic rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.\n"

The water that the sphere is made from is noticeably heavy, As such, those trapped within the water prison cannot ordinarily escape on their own.\n\n## Usage\n- For this reason, water clones can be used in combination with water prisons, either by having the water clone attack other targets while the user maintains the prison, or by having the clones themselves form the prisons, leaving the user free to act.\n- In cases where a water clone forms the water prison, the water of the clone's body can be used as a source for the prison.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * The hands spread in front, palms out seal used for this is visually similar if not the same as the of the real Kuji-in also known as the \"seal of the ring of the sun\" which is shown as hands spread out in front with palms facing out, thumbs and index fingers touching.\n\n## Notes\n- Neji Hyūga was able to free himself by simultaneously releasing chakra from all of his tenketsu, destroying the prison.\n- In Akatsuki Hiden , Kisame Hoshigaki escaped by increasing the volume of water within the prison beyond what it could contain, causing it to burst.\n- In order to maintain the prison, users must stay in contact with the sphere, typically by keeping an arm submerged within it.\n- and can draw in other people to trap upon contact with it.\n- The water prison's usefulness has caused it to be adapted for other purposes.\n- It can be stored in scrolls, trapping anyone who tries to read their contents without permission.\n- Alternatively, users can confine themselves within a water prison, thus preventing opponents from reaching them.\n- * In the anime, this technique is used by soldiers of the Funato Clan.\n"

Under his command, the bubble will take him wherever he wishes.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- It's seemingly very capable of both travelling very long distances and floating rather high into the air with no apparent risk of popping.\n\n## Notes\n- Utakata can also make the bubble camouflage to hide from anyone who's after him.\n- Utakata is also able to take people with him via this technique.\n- Smaller bubbles were seen floating casually alongside it, whereas the first time it was shown, it was just the one bubble.\n- Upon bursting the bubble to get out of it, Utakata can use it do damage nearby opponents.\n- * In Naruto Mobile , Yurui uses a similar ability, encasing the opponent in a huge bubble of bubblegum, inside which he floats above the ground, although not as high as Utakata is capable of.\n- Yurui's bubble also explodes when necessary.\n"

In her battle against Madara Uchiha, Mei was able to use this to overpower and extinguish his Fire Release: Great Fire Destruction — a feat that would normally require many Water Release users working in tandem.\n"

The water wall defends anyone within its perimeter from attack, with the wall's strength being determined by how much of the user's chakra is put into it.\n\n## Usage\n- Users control how long the wall lasts as well as how much water it's made with.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- In Sasuke Shinden , Sasuke Uchiha creates the Water Formation Wall around his allies rather than around himself, providing them a shield while he carries out other tasks.\n- ** In the anime, when Tobirama uses this technique, a different and far more elaborate set of hand seals is used, involving a unique seal of the right hand cupping the left hand with a thumbs-up.\n\n## Notes\n- Because the water is clear, the wall doesn't obstruct the user's vision, allowing them to make their next move uninhibited.\n- In the anime, the water can also be gathered midair, and dispersed in all directions as a form of fire-fighting, or shot from one's hand.\n- * In some video games, such as Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations , Tobirama uses this technique offensively, sending geysers of water outward in front of him.\n"
