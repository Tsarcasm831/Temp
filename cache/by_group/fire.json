Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\n\n## Usage\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.\n- With the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.\n- * Despite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.\n\n## Notes\n- The first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust.\n- Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills.\n- Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\n"

Said to represent the , Amaterasu is the antipode to Tsukuyomi.\n\n## Usage\n- Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks.\n- Because of the ability of his right Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke can control and shape the flames of Amaterasu using Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- In most situations, this makes Amaterasu impossible to avoid.\n- However, with enough speed, it is possible to avoid, dodge, or intercept the jutsu after it has been cast.\n- Amaterasu does not ordinarily require hand seals to be performed, though Sasuke Uchiha once used the Tiger hand seal, which is common for fire techniques.\n- This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person.\n- Other defensive options are pushing the flames away, absorbing them through the Rinnegan, Kāma absorption, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.\n- While impractical as a defence, Amaterasu can also be sealed.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Use of this technique puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed.\n\n## Notes\n- Said to be \"the fires from hell\" and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Throughout the series some objects have shown a degree of imperviousness to the flames, such as Gaara's chakra-infused sand and Naruto's Version 1 chakra cloak.\n- Befitting their description as never disappearing and immortal, Amaterasu's flames cannot be extinguished through most conventional means and will continue burning until their target is completely incinerated; only the user can put out the flames.\n- Though the user can make Amaterasu incinerate things near-instantly when focusing on it, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly normally, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body part(s) before it spreads.\n- Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, was born from the left eye of Izanagi when he performed the cleansing ritual after escaping the underworld.\n"

In Sasuke Uchiha's case, while Amaterasu is cast from his left eye, he uses his right eye to manipulate the flames.\n\n## Usage\n- * The black flames can be used simultaneously with the Chidori to enhance the latter's destructive power.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * Converging the flames in front of the user, a barrier of spike-shaped flames can be created that not only shields him, but also pierces and burns any opponent that touches it.\n\n## Notes\n- * While using the ribcage state of Susanoo, the user can create a defensive encampment by manipulating the flames to cover it.\n- * The user can wield the flames in their hand without being incinerated, as well as manipulate them into a flexible sword which launches spike-shaped projectiles when swung.\n- * The user wraps it around their sword, increasing its potency.\n- Kagutsuchi is the God of Fire in Shinto and the one who brought death into the world by burning his mother, Izanami, to death as she gave birth to him.\n- This made his father, Izanagi, kill him with the Sword of Totsuka.\n- Although the sword formed in this manner was initially identified as \"Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi\", it was later named as part of a derivative technique called \"Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi\".\n- In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , it is named \"Sword of Kagutsuchi\".\n- * In chapter 585, the furigana of this technique's name were written in hiragana, not in katakana, as they're usually written.\n- * According to the fourth databook, Sasuke invented this technique when he fought A, The only people who are confirmed to have wielded the Mangekyō during his lifetime were Madara Uchiha and Izuna Uchiha.\n- ** In the anime, Sasuke is able to put out the black flames of Amaterasu using Kagutsuchi.\n- This resembles the manga, where he put the black flames out as well, although this happened before his alleged invention of the technique.\n"

Sometimes the flames lack a distinct shape, being only a stream, but more often than not they take the form of a giant orb that maintains its shape until hitting a target.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * Several different hand seals have been given for this technique during the course of the series:\n** Rin no Sho lists the hand seals as Horse and Tiger.\n- ** In Naruto: Shippūden episode 4, Kakashi uses an unknown amount of hand seals in quick succession, using many more than the usual six.\n\n## Notes\n- Upon impact, the fireball is powerful enough to crater the ground and vaporise the surroundings.\n- The Uchiha in fact used the Great Fireball Technique as a coming of age rite, with members not being considered true adults until they learned to perform it.\n- In keeping with this, the manga has only ever shown Uchiha using this technique; the anime at times depicts non-Uchiha performing it.\n- ** In Naruto: Shippūden episode 15, Itachi uses Boar, Horse, and Tiger.\n"

It will also drain them of their chakra at a slow but steady rate.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- If the ones who have the seal on them leaves a certain radius from the applier, then it would cause the victims to burst into flames from the inside, burning them to ashes.\n- The user can also ignite the seal at their own free will.\n- The techniques used, however, will be severely hampered, and the seal will cause the user in question intense pain, as though their bodies were on fire; if too much chakra is forced out, the formula will set the victim ablaze.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- * The Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice has been considered to be on par with the Heavenly Prison in terms of restraining prisoners, hence the reason its user was named Mui's successor as Hōzuki Castle's master.\n\n## Notes\n- Mui uses this technique on the prisoners of the Hōzuki Castle.\n- However, for people with high amounts of chakra, such as Naruto, they can still mould chakra and use techniques to a certain extent.\n- It is possible for an individual to undo the Heavenly Prison placed by another, as Benga undid \"Tsukiyo's\" that was placed by Mujō.\n- This may be what Mui did on Maroi.\n- * Despite Naruto being branded with this technique, when he transformed into Sage Mode, he was able to leave a great distance from Mui when Gamabunta escaped the castle to rethink their strategy without Naruto bursting into flames.\n"

Naruto and eight of his shadow clones each form a Rasenshuriken that's been imbued with the unique chakra of a different tailed beast; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra Kaguya Ōtsutsuki would be weak to.\n\n## Notes\n- Jin no Sho describes this as, \"the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time.\"\n\nThe exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:\n#The Rasenshuriken for Shukaku has a similar appearance to the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan, which uses magnetized sand.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Matatabi appears to consist of the same blue fire that Matatabi's body is composed of.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Isobu is seemingly formed out of water.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Son Gokū appears to be the Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Kokuō seems to be emitting steam, which Kokuō's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Saiken resembles a bubbly gas.\n- In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for Wisdom Wolf Decay.\n- In the anime, it appears more analogous to the Soap Bubble Ninjutsu used by Saiken's jinchūriki.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Chōmei has no obvious source in either the manga or anime.\n- Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 identifies it as being composed of Scale Powder.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Gyūki is seemingly made of ink, which Gyūki's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Kurama appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , both known variations of the Lava Release are implied to be present separately within this technique.\n"

Because the wind to flame ratio is perfectly balanced, the flames are greatly enhanced, causing whatever is struck by this technique to be enveloped in a swirling mass of black flames.\n\n## Notes\n- A smaller-scale version of this technique combined a normal Rasenshuriken and black flames manipulated with Kagutsuchi to form a flaming pinwheel.\n- When the technique made contact with the target, they were launched backwards and likewise engulfed in the black flames.\n- * The fact that this technique is referred to as Scorch Release is not because it is a kekkei genkai, but presumably because the basic elements fire and wind make up the actual advanced nature transformation of Scorch Release.\n- * Referring to the original use of this technique, Tobirama Senju noted that he had never seen such a Kagutsuchi before, and that this technique had the same chakra ratio from both its parent techniques, which he noted was something tough to achieve, even for an experienced duo.\n- * Unlike the Rasenshuriken, the small-scale version of this technique doesn't cause cellular damage to either user's arms.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , the jutsu works differently when used in story mode, circling around the Ten-Tails, creating a vortex around it.\n- It also maintained the countless small attacks of the wind chakra.\n- Naruto and Sasuke are also able to use it when in a combined awakening, in this case, the jutsu is called \"Blaze Release: Rasenshuriken\".\n"

Though only the size of a fist, each hides within it the power to obliterate an entire forest.\n\n## Usage\n- Acquisition method may determine the number, as both Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha gained ten orbs upon becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki; Obito initially only formed two, obtaining the other eight upon gaining control of the Ten-Tails' power.\n- In Naruto's case, the orbs currently under his control disappear and reappear alongside his chakra cloak, while the orbs he has discarded remain active.\n- However, the orbs are incapable of nullifying senjutsu, as according to Naruto, natural energy can be used to combat itself.\n- Whatever their shape, users can only control the orbs within 70 metres of their location, allowing opponents to disable them by transporting them elsewhere.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Obito was able to manifest a single Truth-Seeking Ball after absorbing some of Madara's power.\n- Obito on defensive.png|The Sword of Nunoboko (left hand) and a shield (right hand).\n- Madara Jinchuriki anime.png|Madara's shakujō.\n\n## Notes\n- whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo.\n- Entering Tenseigan Chakra Mode also grants the user Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- The number of Truth-Seeking Balls acquired varies from user to user.\n- Upon receiving power from Hagoromo, Naruto Uzumaki, instead gained nine orbs, while Asura Ōtsutsuki only showed five orbs, nine orbs in the anime.\n- Toneri Ōtsutsuki is depicted with an inconsistent amount.\n- and users cannot create additional orbs after the initial acquisition number; thus, orbs that are lost for whatever reason cannot be replaced.\n- Clones are not created with orbs of their own, though the user can temporarily transfer them to a clone.\n- Truth-Seeking Balls encompass the power of all five basic natures, and as such they surpass both kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.\n- If imbued with a certain Yin–Yang Release jutsu, the orbs can nullify any ninjutsu they touch and thus become impervious to it; this includes negating the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation, making it possible to permanently damage and kill those reincarnated by the technique.\n- Naruto can use Truth-Seeking Balls to create his Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.\n- Similarly, Obito was able to convert one of his orbs into black receivers, allowing him to use the Six Red Yang Formation.\n- While in their default sphere form, the orbs can be launched as high-speed projectiles, expanded to enormous sizes in an instant.\n- Because the high-density chakra is in a condensed state, it can be pulled and stretched into a smooth and flat consistency, as well as freely manipulated into any other shape.\n- though Obito does so by passing them through holes that temporarily form in his hands.\n- Though highly durable, this defence can still be broken by attacks that cannot be nullified, such as powerful senjutsu and taijutsu.\n- Gudōdama 1.png|Stretched around the user as a defence.\n- Gudōdama 2.png|A weapon with adjustable length and thickness, called a in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing .\n- Obito generates Receiver.png|Converted into black receivers.\n- Obito stops Naruto and Sasuke.png|Used similar to chakra arms.\n- Truth-Seeking Orb Platform.png|Reshaped to serve as a platform.\n- Obito Second Transformation.png|Obito's shakujō.\n- NTCM and SPSM.png|Naruto's .\n- Rather than simple black constructs, Toneri demonstrated the ability to transform one of these glowing orbs into an ornate golden cage.\n- He could also combine them to create a massive vortex capable of blasting through the moon's surface and a giant sword capable of cutting the entire moon in half.\n- * Despite stating that the orbs are wielded by Six Paths Senjutsu users, the fourth databook does not classify this technique as senjutsu.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and Jump Force , Truth-Seeking Balls give off a purple glow.\n- In the former, Obito employs the orbs in several unique ways, such as forming scythes, drills, spinning disks, hands capable of firing Tailed Beast Balls and blasts of chakra.\n- * Despite repeatedly accessing his orbs every time he entered Six Paths Sage Mode during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has not been seen accessing them since whenever using said form.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , Obito has a technique called , in which he combines his Truth-Seeking Balls into a single expanding orb that obliterates the surrounding area.\n- The technique refers to the Trailokya, the three realms of karmic rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.\n"
