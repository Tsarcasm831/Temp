The linear motion and force applied to draw the sword from the scabbard results in slashes that are faster and stronger than ones executed with the sword already drawn.",

            "This Kāma served its purpose and vanished when Isshiki was forced to reincarnate through Jigen's body.",
            "**Kawaki:** Upon realising that Jigen's body would not be able to sustain his chakra, Isshiki transferred his Kāma into Kawaki's left palm through scientific experiments and a ritual conducted with the aid of Amado Sanzu.",
            "He lost this Kāma when Isshiki resurrected via Jigen's body, but later it was secretly reapplied by Amado while restoring Kawaki's right arm, for it to function purely as a weapon after Isshiki's soul vanished.",
            "Isshiki's Kāma in Kawaki was estimated to be 80% extracted prior to its removal.",
            "By the first battle against Code, the Kāma was advanced enough let Kawaki access Isshiki's raw power and various abilities, including Isshiki's dōjutsu.",
            "As such he bears a White Kāma, which is located on his left palm.",
            "As Code is not a vessel, his Kāma did not vanish upon Isshiki's revival into Jigen's body, and before his soul expired, Isshiki entrusted Code with carrying on the Ōtsutsuki's will and bade him to become a complete Ōtsutsuki by sacrificing either Boruto or Kawaki to Ten-Tails and feeding upon the resulting God Tree's chakra fruit.",
            "Upon facing Code, Momoshiki's Kāma in Boruto had reached 82% extracted.",
            "These enhanced combat abilities and power exist for the sake of protecting the Kāma's vessel.",
            "Kāma can also be used as a medium for Space-Time Ninjutsu, transforming the mark on their palm into a symbol resembling their horn pattern and opening a rift to any location, including foreign dimensions.",
            "If one properly draws on their Kāma, they can overlay the accumulated with their mind and body, instantly becoming a seasoned fighter.",
            "According to Code, this is the true essence of Kāma and grants the user an exponential increase in battle power, well beyond that conferred by the enhanced physical abilities alone.",
            "With enough experience, the user can progress the Kāma to a more powerful state, gaining access to the Ōtsutsuki's unique powers, including their Shinjutsu.",
            "Isshiki and Amado theorised that it was this resonance that allowed both Kawaki's and Boruto's Kāma to mature more rapidly than expected.",
            "Although Jigen is able to synchronise with Kawaki's Kāma to open a space-time rift, no such resonance exist between the two of them as Kawaki did not experience the sudden growth until his contact with Boruto.",
            "This resonance also often caused Boruto's Kāma to activate involuntarily when Kawaki activated his own.",
            "In order to maintain control in such instances they must attempt to minimise the amount of chakra they absorb to prevent the vessel from awakening.",
            "This is the true purpose of Kāma, and allows the Ōtsutsuki to transcend death.",
            "Even if the vessel's body dies and is severely damaged and/or not fully compatible with the Ōtsutsuki, or the Ōtsutsuki is only partially manifested, so long as it exists and still bears Kāma, it will remain viable for the Ōtsutsuki to resurrect through, in which any damage it has suffered will be healed.",
            "With the aid of technology developed by Amado Sanzu, Isshiki was able to transfer his Kāma to other individuals using Jigen as an intermediary, albeit with a low rate of success, as of fifteen known test subjects, thirteen are confirmed to have died, with Kawaki the only known successful recipient.",
            "Amado wants Kawaki to use a similar method to embed a Kāma containing the biological data of his daughter, Akebi Sanzu, into a clone of her in order to facilitate her resurrection.",
            "Amado noted that there is no known way of removing a Kāma from a vessel, nor to stop its takeover, aside from killing the vessel before the resurrection process completes itself; even the very Ōtsutsuki who placed the seal onto the vessel cannot control the automatic transfer.",
            "However, the Kāma's final process of resurrection will not occur so long as the Ōtsutsuki in question is still alive, hence Isshiki was not reborn through Jigen's body despite the Kāma already having extracted all the data into Jigen's body.",
            "Upon being resurrected, should there be any other Kāma implanted by the same Ōtsutsuki, those additional Kāma will simultaneously be erased.",
            "However, despite the Kāma's erasure, any Ōtsutsuki data that was already extracted will remain so.",
            "Also, White Kāma will not disappear if an Ōtsutsuki resurrects via a complete Kāma.",
            "Alternatively, the soul of the Ōtsutsuki can alter the remaining programming of their Kāma to rebuild the vessel's body once, saving their soul but cancelling the resurrection.",
            "Though untested, Kawaki hypothesises that he and Boruto may be able to produce Kāma of their own, as they have each already had in excess of 80% of their body overwritten by Ōtsutsuki genetic data.",
            "Kawaki also theorises that Code, bearer of a White Kāma, would be an ideal candidate for Boruto to use as a vessel, as Code proved himself being compatible to survive the process while not being anyone's vessel.",
            "Amado claims to be able to restore Kawaki's Kāma, which would restore his access to the Ōtsutsuki powers in his body without the drawback of being taken over by Isshiki, as his soul has vanished.",
            "As this requires sacrificing a percentage of the compressed data in their Kāma, it makes it impossible for them to fully overwrite the cells of their vessel, and thus unable to complete their resurrection.",
            "When applying a Kāma normally, it seems to have no detrimental effects on the potential vessel, whether they are compatible or not, as neither Jigen nor Boruto suffer any negative effects nor any apparent pain.",
            "However, when Isshiki attempted to place another one while inhabiting Jigen, he and Amado utilised a seemingly different method that involved scientific aid, in which Isshiki would activate the seal from Jigen, and spread it to a recipient, causing them intense pain and, if incompatible, the recipient would most likely die, as thirteen children died this way.",
            "It is also possible that a failure be instead be gifted the White Kāma, granting them the pure power of an Ōtsutsuki but not as a receptacle for the soul.",
            "As Amado noted, the most important factor of applying Kāma is the selection of the vessel; if an Ōtsutsuki uses an inadequate vessel for a revival, the body will be unable to handle the enormous chakra, and most likely die within a couple of days.",
            "Compatibility seems to be rare, as out of the fifteen children Isshiki attempted, Kawaki is the sole success, and Isshiki himself noted how Boruto's affinity with Momoshiki's Kāma to be uncommon.",
            "Placing a Kāma onto a clone is ineffective, as the mark will vanish and will not transfer back to the original.",
            "Once the Kāma is applied, its process of spreading the biological data into the vessel and the final resurrection initiates automatically, in which not even the caster can control it.",
            "When an Ōtsutsuki resurrects, this also causes all Kāma currently existing on other vessels to disappear.",
            "This leaves the Ōtsutsuki vulnerable to a permanent death as there is no other vessels to anchor their soul in the living realm and ultimately extinguished, unless they can apply another Kāma, especially if forced by circumstance to resurrect in an imperfect vessel.",
            "He originally hoped to use it to weaken Isshiki, and theorises that this drug can stall Momoshiki from reincarnating through Boruto, as the Byakugan originates from the Ōtsutsuki, and weakening the kekkei genkai may slow the Kāma that is transforming Boruto's cells.",
            "An individual who has been given Kāma is viable to serve as a sacrifice for Ten-Tails, as they technically become Ōtsutsuki.",
            "Similarly, even if the data has been fully extracted but the vessel has yet to be reborn as Ōtsutsuki, if said vessel is incompatible with the Kāma to begin with, this will also result in the God Tree's reduced size and ability to produce a fruit.",
            "Using Kāma in battle could prove taxing for less skilled users, even more so when they are already weakened, as Kawaki quickly collapsed after using it against Garō as he was already injured from defeating Kara's robots while Boruto was left so badly weakened after using it for the first time that he collapsed and had to be helped to return to Konoha.",
            "Additionally, activating it seems to cause a not sufficiently experienced user some pain, as Boruto expressed pain whenever he activates Kāma.",
            "Jigen doesn't seem to suffer these weaknesses as he is much more capable at using them than either Boruto or Kawaki, as he never showed any reaction when activating Kāma and using it in his prolonged battle with Naruto and Sasuke had no effect on him.",
            "However, one known weakness of the seal that even Jigen seems to suffer from is that incomplete vessels could breakdown from channelling Kāma's full power, as after overpowering Naruto and Sasuke, the blackened section of his body cracked and he even cried soon afterwards and was forced to retreat back to be treated by Amado.",
            "Kāma can only absorb energy-based substances, like chakra, hence the wielder is vulnerable to physical matter based attacks or abilities such as viruses and natural flames.",
            "Furthermore, if a chakra-based construct is composited with enough physical matter, Kāma cannot absorb it.",
            "* \"Kāma\" means \"wish\", \"desire\", or \"longing\" in Hindu literature, and in Japanese it is also an uncommon way to write \"karma\".",
            "* Sarada Uchiha has theorised, due to their similar appearance, that the Strength of a Hundred Seal may be related to it.",
            "*** Amado compared the Kāma's function to a sugar cube placed into a cup of coffee:** both would slowly spread throughout their vessels, and upon completion, both would dissolve and disappear.",
            "* Any Ōtsutsuki who intends to become a sacrifice for the Ten-Tails to bloom into a God Tree utilises Kāma to prepare a vessel beforehand, for their revival later on.",
            "** At 80% of data extraction in a vessel from a Kāma, Momoshiki believes this is sufficient to make the target a sacrifice for the Ten-Tails.",
            "* In the anime, Isshiki had also attempted to apply the Kāma on adults.",
            "However, Garō did not gain a White Kāma.",
            "* When Momoshiki used the Shadow Clone Technique through his vessel, his Kāma applied to his clone, but when Boruto used the technique Kāma didn't apply to his clones."

Mei changes chakra inside her body into a powerful acidic fluid that will melt anything and spits out the viscous fluid from her mouth.",

    "summary": "The Puppet Technique is the core skill of a fighting style, whereby they control a puppet. Monzaemon originally intended the Puppet Technique for purely entertainment purposes, but by collaborating with shinobi he adapted the skill for combat.",
    "technique": [
      "Performing the Puppet Technique involves emitting from a user's fingers to connect to a puppet, with the fingers' movements controlling the puppet's actions.",
      "Controlling a puppet requires most of a puppeteer's attentions and maintaining the threads is a constant drain on their chakra.",
      "The threads can also be used to wrap around opponents in order to restrict their movements.",
      "The threads can be connected to opponents to impede their movements, such as by tripping them, or to take control of their body, using them as a puppet.",
      "The Ōtsutsuki were able to control their puppets (or other people) remotely from seemingly any distance.",
      "Naruto the Movie explains that this was achieved by placing orbs of chakra within the puppets' bodies, allowing the Ōtsutsuki to control their puppets through thought alone.",
      "Over time, these puppets became mostly autonomous, requiring no conscious effort to control and only needing the Tenseigan to power their movements.",
      "In Gaara Hiden , after Kankurō studies reports of the Ōtsutsuki's puppets, he achieves a similar effect by using imperceptibly thin chakra threads; although this doesn't make his puppets autonomous, it does significantly increase the range he can control them from.",
      "In some Naruto video games, Kankurō demonstrates greater versatility in hand-to-hand combat than puppeteers are said to possesses, as he mixes his puppet control with haymakers and other forms of taijutsu.",
      "In the years following the technique's creation, Suna's shinobi became pioneers in the art of puppetry, with its Puppet Brigade being given the specific mandate of finding new ways to use and exploit puppets for battle.",
      "No matter how many threads are being used per puppet, the user's will plays a large role in a puppet's movements, thus creating an inevitable time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response.",
      "It should also be noted that, while the Chakra Threads are difficult to notice, it is possible to cut them, effectively disabling the puppet in the process.",
      "Because puppeteers rely on their puppets for almost all aspects of combat, keeping the puppets safe is of paramount importance.",
      "At the simplest, this means not allowing the puppets to be destroyed or otherwise disabled.",
      "More than that, it is also vital to keep how a puppet works secret from opponents.",
      "If an opponent knows what weapons or traps a puppet is outfitted with, the puppeteer will lose the advantage of surprise that so often gives them the upperhand.",
      "If an opponent knows how a puppet is designed – which, unlike weapons and traps, cannot be greatly altered by the puppeteer – they can focus their attacks on the puppet's structural weaknesses.",
      "If a puppeteer does lose their puppet in battle (or if they merely opt not to use one), the chakra threads remain a versatile tool.",
      "Puppeteers can attach chakra threads to faraway targets even without this subterfuge, giving them a quick way to bring objects to their side.",
      "- practised by Sasori and Kankurō.",
      "- practised by Kankurō and Shinki.",
      "He achieved this by connecting his chakra threads to pipes that distributed chakra across Rōran, expanding the number of threads and distance he could cover."

    "summary": "This reincarnation ninjutsu is one of the many subjects documented at the centuries-old Astronomy Research Institute, an archive of knowledge for the Land of Redaku. A few years prior to the events of Sasuke Retsuden , Zansūru, an archaeologist, deciphered enough of the relevant research to learn how to use this technique.",
    "technique": [
      "How the user controls the reincarnated is never made clear, only that there are no talismans placed in the skulls as is done with the Impure World Reincarnation.",
      "The user's control over those they reincarnate is great enough that it can't be overcome with standard genjutsu.",
      "Sasuke is able to somewhat erode the control over one dinosaur, Menō, by speaking to him kindly, refusing to harm him, and by offering to return him to the afterlife, something that Menō wants.",
      "This momentarily allows him to establish control over Menō with a genjutsu, which he then makes permanent by channelling his chakra into Menō's body to overwrite Jiji's control.",
      "Having control of a reincarnated form grants certain advantages.",
      "Information gathered by the reincarnated can be instantly passed along to their controller, such as to help the controller locate somebody they're searching for.",
      "Conversely, the controller can pass some of their chakra to the reincarnated, enhancing their strength: Menō, a juvenile of his species, is able to overpower an adult of the same species because he has access to Sasuke's chakra.",
      "Control of one or more reincarnated subjects can be granted to non-users - as Jiji does to Zansūru - but these non-users cannot give commands that are too complicated.",
      "One dinosaur is even shown clinging to its reincarnated body, using the brief window of no longer being controlled to attack Jiji, vengeance for having brought it back to the living world.",
      "However, because he was not a ninja, he recruited Jiji to perform it on his behalf.",
      "A few decades prior to this, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama Senju's Impure World Reincarnation.",
      "Zansūru insists that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant.",
      "Like the Impure World Reincarnation, this technique brings back souls of the dead using living sacrifices; Jiji exclusively reincarnates dinosaurs (more commonly called \"dragons\"), but also planned to reincarnate a human, Margo, until he found out that she wasn't actually dead.",
      "Jiji summons a dinosaur's soul using its fossilised remains and places its soul in the body of the live sacrifice: a chicken, one of the closest extant relatives of dinosaurs.",
      "Dust and ash encase the chicken's body, giving it the same size and appearance as the dinosaur had in life.",
      "The dinosaur's reincarnated body retains all the physical skills it had when it was alive.",
      "In the novel, it also has the added advantage of being immortal; it can be damaged, but its body will repair itself indefinitely regardless of severity.",
      "Not all wounds heal at the same speed, with burns being observed to still linger after several days.",

      "** Those who have mastered the Sage Techniques of the Ryūchi Cave have shown the ability to use natural energy to breathe life into inorganic substances and control them.",
      "The combination of both forms allows for a greater power than either Tailed Beast Mode or Sage Mode individually, which allowed Naruto to hold his own against the likes of Obito Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki.",
      "Users of Sage Mode must possess \"extreme chakra levels\" to invoke senjutsu.",
      "It is also important that their bodies be strong enough to support the increased power.",
      "Orochimaru, who discovered the Ryūchi Cave and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, was not able to use Sage Transformation to enter Sage Mode for this reason.",
      "In order to enter Sage Mode, the gatherer must remain absolutely still in order to be one with nature and balance the natural energy with their own physical and spiritual energies.",
      "If the user puts too little natural energy into using senjutsu, the technique will not work.",
      "Conversely, if too much natural energy is taken in, their body will turn to stone forever; humans will also be transformed into whichever animal's school the senjutsu was learned from.",
      "The toads of Mount Myōboku have devised several tools to make learning Sage Mode easier.",
      "By applying a special oil, the applicant's body will start passively taking in natural energy.",
      "This oil will evaporate if taken outside Mount Myōboku, thus rendering it useful only for learning purposes.",
      "The toads also have a special staff that, when struck with, knocks all the natural energy out of the gatherer, thus reversing any transformations before they can become permanent and the user turns to stone.",
      "At Ryūchi Cave, one must be bitten by the White Snake Sage, who injects them with natural energy.",

      "Users have at times been shown entering Sage Mode without this preparation.",
      "Because the user needs to move during combat, the senjutsu chakra cannot be replenished, which means the user can't stay within this state for extended periods of time.",
      "Naruto states it is possible to lengthen the time limit.",
      "Another option is to employ shadow clones.",
      "The clones can gather natural energy elsewhere and are dispelled when the energy is needed, thus transferring the gathered energy to the original.",
      "For Naruto, this limited the number of shadow clones that he can have active at a time to five, for as long as the clones are gathering natural energy, creating any more than that would disrupt the clones' focus.",
      "If the user continually practices the use of their Sage Mode, then the time needed to recharge their sage chakra can be drastically shortened.",
      "If the user is also a jinchūriki that has achieved harmony with their tailed beast, they can drastically speed up their ability to gather natural energy in tailed beast mode to the point of only needing a few seconds to fully charge or recharge their sage chakra.",
      "Tailed beasts can also assist their jinchūriki in gathering natural energy with their own chakra reserves.",
      "The one exception is a dark pigmentation around their eyes and the eyes themselves, which usually differ based on where the user learned Sage Mode.",
      "Jiraiya was not able to properly balance his own chakra with natural energy, and as a result his appearance took on a number of toad-like traits when using Sage Mode: his nose grew bigger and gained warts, his teeth turned sharp, he grew a goatee, and acquired toad-like eyes.",
      "Because of these traits, Jiraiya did not like to use Sage Mode as it \"displeased the ladies\".",
      "Some of the physical alterations, such as the toad posture and the webbed feet, were beneficial and improved his manoeuvrability, and he could consciously manifest the alterations in order to take advantage of them.",
