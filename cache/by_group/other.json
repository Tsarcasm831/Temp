More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body.\n\n## Notes\n- The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg.\n- As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.\n- The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise.\n- He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha, and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu Hōzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.\n- Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.\n- The swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.\n- Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.\n- In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.\n"

When these bones pierce a living organism, the bone and target starts to deteriorate at a molecular level, disintegrating the victim and reducing their bodies to nothing more than a pile of ash.\n\n## Notes\n- Kaguya has used this attack in a variety of ways: as a projectile attack, incorporating the use of her dimension-manifesting abilities to land a two-sided attack as well as a close-range melee attack.\n- Unlike other certain-kill techniques, in which the victim can survive if they possess extraordinary endurance, this technique is guaranteed to kill the victim if it connects and thus, truly lives up to the name of certain-kill techniques.\n- * The Shikotsumyaku kekkei genkai is derived from Kaguya's ability to manipulate and weaponise her own bone structure.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , Kaguya has techniques named and , both of which utilise numerous Yomotsu Hirasaka portals to launch a barrage of bone spears at her enemy.\n"

To relocate such large dimensions requires an immense amount of chakra, so much so that only Kaguya is able to do so.\n\n## Usage\n- Kaguya does seem to have some control over where she and the others will appear within a dimension, giving her a strategic option: when first depicted, she shifts high into the air of her lava dimension, leaving her opponents to fall into the molten sea below; when she is being attacked by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, she shifts to a part of her ice dimension that places Naruto and Sasuke within a glacier, trapping them and thus stopping their attack.\n\n## Notes\n- To an onlooker, Kaguya and everyone else will appear to simply vanish from the previous dimension they were in, without even a detectable trace of their chakra left behind.\n- Those affected by Amenominaka will maintain their positions relative to each other between dimensions, so that somebody approaching Kaguya in one dimension will still be approaching her in the next.\n- Because Amenominaka works on everybody in the vicinity of Kaguya, she cannot use it to escape from attackers or to transport only certain individuals to other dimensions; for both purposes, she instead relies on Yomotsu Hirasaka.\n- When Kakashi Hatake first experiences Amenominaka, he believes it is the result of a genjutsu because of how suddenly it happens and how stark the change is from where he was (Earth).\n- It is only from noticing that the new world is too vast in size and intricate in detail that he realises it cannot be a mere illusion.\n- He nevertheless revisits the genjutsu comparison later, noting that - from his perspective - Kaguya seems to be instantly rewriting reality with each use of Amenominaka.\n- * Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 gives each dimensional shift a unique name; Amenominaka: , , , as well as one for returning from her dimensions, .\n"

By shifting to another space during combat, Sasuke can avoid his opponent's techniques in an instant, and by swapping places with a weapon, such as his sword, he can leave behind a trap for an approaching enemy.\n\n## Usage\n- This allows him to transport a weapon into his hand, or to project one of his techniques, such as the Chidori, to a remote location.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Only one time did he transport another person with thin air, and that was when he teleported Madara between himself and Naruto in an attempt to seal him as the Ten-Tails jinchūriki.\n- * Despite being a space–time ninjutsu rather than accelerated movement, Naruto Uzumaki once described this technique as being similar to the Body Flicker Technique.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Sasuke can also use this technique to escape from restraints and bind an opponent in his place, or to discard any foreign weapons embedded in his body.\n- Upon first obtaining his Rinnegan, Sasuke had to wait for his eye to recharge after using this technique several times in quick succession, and further overuse would cause his eye to bleed.\n\n## Notes\n- Despite this technique stemming from his Rinnegan, Sasuke does not actually need to be looking at an object in order to swap places with it.\n- Sasuke can also target other objects and individuals with this technique in order to shift them to another space in his surroundings.\n- However, the opponent must be within a certain range of him for this to take effect, and with sufficient speed, it is possible to escape this technique's range before it can be activated.\n- While storing the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, Sasuke demonstrated the ability to shift both himself and his Susanoo behind Naruto Uzumaki, who was a considerable distance away.\n- In adulthood, Sasuke is able to use this technique even while his Rinnegan's ocular power is diminished due to using its other abilities.\n- The technique's workings may be derived from the Iwato dance of the Sada Shrine; after Ame-no-tajikarao opens the cave and Amaterasu emerges, he takes her place inside the cave.\n"

As with any cursed seal, the chosen person would faint upon acquiring the seal from apparent pain.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- This cursed seal is not the source of its power; rather, it serves as a blueprint to create a potion that will grant the drinker power akin to an actual cursed seal.\n- By activating several hand seals, the ingredient names will appear in the corresponding slot sections of the seal.\n- The seal is applied onto Mizuki's right forearm.\n- By pressing a button on the edge of the stone tablet, the slots would release the liquified ingredients down the channels, where they would mix together at different sequences, and when all of them meet at the end to the bottom of the tablet and the potion itself is formed, the colour becomes a glowing crimson, similar to when the cursed seal patterns spread across a person's body.\n- Unique as this cursed seal is, even the markings gained differs from the typical ones: this seal's first stage does not spread in a pattern across the user's body, but instead gives Mizuki stripes on his arms and face alone; the second stage does not give him a beige-skin mutation, but instead a bipedal-animal form.\n- * In Naruto Mobile, when entering the second level of the seal, Mizuki releases a stream of red chakra throughout his body, similar to the Jinchūriki's chakra cloak, increasing his speed and attacks.\n\n## Notes\n- Said potion consists of genetic information of animals which would be combined with the drinker's body to release an explosive amount of power.\n- The ingredients may be found in the Nara clan's laboratory, which is hidden deep within the mountains.\n- The potion can then be formed in a secret room in a mountainous cavern: ingredients are placed and mixed on a giant tablet matching that of the tattoo.\n- Tsunade believed that no ordinary shinobi would be able to copy the method of this mixture, and that the skills of an artisan would be required.\n- The inside, however, consists of various ducts and slots, leading to a bottom slot at the \"jaw\".\n- While the potion ingredients are grounded into liquid and poured into their respective slots, they each have a different colour.\n- With his strengthened muscles, he was able to smash his opponents through solid ground and throw them to great distances.\n- He also gained tremendous increase in speed, allowing him to overrun both Naruto Uzumaki and Iruka Umino with ease, appearing as a barely visible blur whenever he moved.\n- Iruka also noted that Mizuki's chakra levels rose drastically.\n- When the second level is reached, the user will gain specific characteristics of the animal, along with immense increases in their strength and abilities.\n- Since Mizuki added the extracts of a tiger to the mix, he transformed into a bipedal tiger, with increase in strength, but a great drop in speed and sharpness in his attacks.\n- Because the sudden burst of power places a huge burden on the cells, far beyond a body's limit, and the results will backfire, destroying the user's body.\n- For Mizuki's case, the potion was incomplete when he drank it, so when the effects dissipated, he shrivelled up into a malnourished and powerless old man, and would have died if not for Tsunade's medical skills.\n- Regardless, Mizuki lost all of his powers and could never be a ninja again.\n- The stone table required to mix the ingredients is hidden under the stone floor, which requires a hidden chain switch, underneath the eighth wall tile on the right side from the entrance, to be pulled, to trigger the hydraulics to open the trapdoor and elevate the table.\n"

These creatures appear to be immortal, as they were killed and later summoned again.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Worthy of note, summoning creatures through the Animal Path require no blood sacrifice or hand seals.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- In the case of Nagato, having originally channelled the Animal Path through the corpse of a Fūma clan shinobi and then the corpse of Ajisai in life, the creatures summoned appear to have undergone the same modifications as his Paths of Pain, having chakra receivers embedded in their bodies.\n- ;Summons:\n* Giant Drill-Beaked Bird\n* Giant Multi-Headed Dog\n* Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon\n* Giant Panda\n* Giant Ox\n* Giant Rhino\n* Giant Crustacean\n* Giant Centipede\n* The other Paths of Pain\n* Konan\n\n## Influences\n\nBuddhists believe that animals inhabit a different dimension separated from humans not spatially but mentally, called the \"Tiryagyoni realm\"; an unhappy plane of rebirth which revolves around fear, instinct and survival of the fittest, suffered by those animals that work for humans and, above all, by those ignorant to what is happening to them.\n\n## Notes\n- The Animal Path can also summon people using hand signs, such as the case of Nagato's Paths and Konan.\n- Tactics-wise, the Animal Path's primary role in battle appears to consist of overwhelming multiple opponents with a barrage of summons.\n- Nagato also tends to send the Animal Path first into battle to throw enemies off about the number of enemies they are really facing.\n- As they also display the Rinnegan, the creatures serve as extensions of Nagato.\n- During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used his summons for transport before being rejuvenated to move on his own power.\n"

It uses all of Kurama's chakra present in its jinchūriki, resulting in the permanent exhaustion of the Tailed Beast's chakra in the user.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- When in use, it dramatically boosts Naruto's reflexes, speed, and power to such extremes that he even surpasses Isshiki's capabilities, allowing him to snatch the Ōtsutsuki's black rods out of the air before they are visibly enlarged, as well as dodge and effortlessly parry attacks.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Because of the extreme risk, the user must not make any unnecessary movements, nor act on any stray thoughts, focusing on only the most calculated of moves to keep Baryon Mode stable.\n- Even more, over-usage of this form comes at an even greater risk at Kurama's life altogether, effectively killing it.\n\n## Notes\n- His whisker markings become thicker, with the upper ones on each side curving up below his eyes.\n- The pigments around his eyes become black and stretch up towards his makeshift fox ears, and he takes on Kurama's red-slit eyes.\n- The colouring of his clothes turns slightly darker orange, and he gains a chakra cape with a black swirl in the middle of his chest.\n- Flowing from the back of his cape are four orange (red in the anime) chakra tails, with five more at the end of the cape; each tail has a black line down the centre that connects in the middle of the cape as a swirl.\n- In a process similar to nuclear fusion, Naruto's and Kurama's chakra are consumed as raw materials to produce a new type of energy.\n- The increase in chakra was enough to shock both Isshiki and Sasuke, with the latter noting it being tremendous.\n- Kurama notes that because all chakra is connected, contact with an opponent will drain their lifespan as well.\n- Doing so will gradually drain at the user's strength and very lifespan.\n- Upon reaching the breaking point, Kurama's entire being will be destroyed, depriving Naruto of all the kitsune's chakra and capacities.\n- However, the removal of Kurama from its jinchūriki will not endanger the latter's life.\n- Despite his death, Kurama was eventually revived as with any Tailed Beasts who would die, albeit not within Naruto.\n- The most common examples are protons and neutrons, which are the particles that undergo fusion in the Sun.\n- * Baryon Mode seems to embody the Will of Fire, with Naruto's chakra cloak incorporating the symbol and strongly resembling the monument in the Konoha Cemetery.\n- It also resembles Kushina's hair when she's angry, getting into her \"Red Hot-Blooded Habanero\" moniker.\n"

By doing this, the Inuzuka gains a copy of themselves that serves the same practical purpose as a shadow clone but without a shadow clone's steep chakra requirement.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- To counteract this, the Inuzuka typically uses an Imitation Beast Ninja Art, causing them to act more feral and thus make it harder to tell them apart.\n\n## Notes\n- Even though they look identical, the ninken - because it's an animal - is likely to give away which of the two is which from how it moves and acts.\n- When the Beast Human Clone is first used during the Chūnin Exams arc, Akamaru is seemingly the one to use this technique after he's been fed a soldier pill.\n- When it's used again during the Sasuke Recovery Mission, it is seemingly performed by Akamaru's partner, Kiba Inuzuka, instead.\n- On both occasions, the Beast Human Clone's use typically precedes the Fang Passing Fang.\n- By Part II, the Beast Human Clone no longer seems necessary for Kiba and Akamaru's manoeuvres, presumably because Akamaru's natural size is much closer to Kiba's than it was in Part I.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Kiba calls this technique .\n"

It uses the same concept of compressing spinning chakra in one's palm as in the original Rasengan, only increasing the amount of chakra involved.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan is much larger than the original, almost being as big as Pain's summons.\n\n## Notes\n- Because there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.\n- When Naruto first starts using the Big Ball Rasengan, he needs a shadow clone to help him form and wield it.\n- He is able to wield it with one hand when his skill with it improves, though he still needs a clone's help in its formation.\n- The size and power of his Big Ball Rasengan also improved, with it growing to nearly half the size of the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan.\n- As with the original, Naruto uses a shadow clone to help him form the ball.\n- With this senjutsu version, however, he can have a shadow clone form a Big Ball Rasengan in each of his hands, which he can then pass to the clones for them to wield.\n- In fact, he could use this technique in Jiraiya's novel within Tsunade's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream.\n- ** By the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto's regular Rasengan had increased to near Big Ball Rasengan size.\n- * When Konohamaru used this technique in an OVA, he was able to use it with one hand.\n"

      "markdown": "# Black Receiver\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Rinnegan, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu\n- Class: Offensive, Supplementary\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Black Zetsu, Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara Uchiha, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, Nagato, Obito Uchiha, Urashiki Ōtsutsuki~anime, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki~game\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie\n\n## Summary\nBlack Receivers are black rods that function as demodulators for high-frequency chakra signals. Users are able to create and transmit their chakra into these receivers for a variety of purposes.\n\n## Usage\n- On one occasion, these rods pierced Nagato's back and drained him of his life force, which allowed him to control the statue.\n- * Black rods have sprouted from Obito's artificial right half on several occasions: upon first awakening his Mangekyō Sharingan and using Wood Release, when Madara used the rods to control his actions, and when Black Zetsu first coated his body and forced him to revive Madara.\n- * When Obito was the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, he converted one of his Truth-Seeking Balls into six black receivers, which he used to activate the Six Red Yang Formation.\n- As they are controlled by the user's chakra, opponents can prevent these bodies from moving by removing all of their receivers.\n- The creatures Nagato summoned through the Animal Path were also embedded with numerous receivers, suggesting he controlled them in a similar manner.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The receivers implanted in Obito's Six Paths of Pain doubled as a means of temporarily binding the chakra of the tailed beasts sealed inside the Demonic Statue to their bodies, making them into jinchūriki.\n- His absorb chakra instead of transmitting his own to disrupt the chakra of those it pierces.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Offensively employing receivers from afar carries a risk, as those with sensing capabilities can trace the transmitted chakra back to the user when pierced with one.\n- The user can fully immobilise the target by stabbing them with multiple rods, Aside from being stabbed, simply touching the receivers can apparently also incur negative effects,\n\nChakra receivers are also used to control the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that possess copies of the Rinnegan, granting them a shared field of vision with their creator.\n- Nagato controlled his Six Paths of Pain using numerous receivers fashioned into piercings, which were implanted all about their bodies, whereas Obito had a single rod implanted in each body's chest.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble , Pain's Black Needle Stab temporarily reverses the controls of those stabbed by his black rods.\n\n## Notes\n- However, there have been several instances in which black rods were produced through other means:\n* While connected to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara Uchiha produced a black rod from Hashirama's artificial body and identified it as a physical manifestation of his will.\n- He then told Obito Uchiha to use it when performing the Six Paths Technique.\n- They are durable enough to break steel scalpels, as well as sharp enough to pierce through human bodies with ease.\n- Though durable, the rods can still be destroyed when struck with sufficient force, and their creator is able to break them apart without any apparent difficulty.\n- Once formed, the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation.\n- Though chakra being sent to these receivers can be sensed, a skilled user can prevent their location from being discovered by constantly changing the frequency of their chakra.\n- When receiving chakra, the black rods noticeably heat up.\n- Among other Rinnegan abilities, the bodies are capable of producing additional rods to serve as weapons.\n- When they entered Tailed Beast Mode, the receivers would relocate from the jinchūriki's chests up to the tailed beasts' necks.\n- When employed offensively, the black rods make for effective weapons.\n- They can emerge from the user's hand to stab opponents, be broken off and wielded like swords, or be launched as high-speed projectiles, and the size and shape of the generated receivers can be adjusted to fit the situation.\n- He can also manifest chakra chains to bind those touching the receivers with an even greater binding power.\n- In the anime, the user can also apply shape transformation to the rods after launching them, altering them into more elaborate forms.\n- Black receivers disintegrate when their creator is killed or similarly incapacitated, alongside any Truth-Seeking Balls they may possess.\n- though they do eventually heal.\n- * Isshiki Ōtsutsuki has employed similar tools; however, they're different in that Isshiki has no Rinnegan, and they function differently.\n"

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.\n\n## Usage\n- Once the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head.\n- Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.\n\n## Notes\n- The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.\n- Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.\n- While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\n- Kabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman.\n- Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him.\n- Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail.\n- * The clones created through this method lack clothing, unlike individuals revived with Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation.\n"

This can then be used for highly accurate incisions necessary for surgeries and anatomical dissections.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Unlike regular scalpels, the chakra scalpel can make cuts inside the body without actually creating an open wound, limiting the risks of an infection.\n\n## Notes\n- The chakra scalpel can also be used offensively to inflict internal damage, although it requires great precision to be effective.\n- Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual.\n- In heated combat, even the greatest medical-nin won't be able to exert the precision needed to target the vital spots, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile.\n- Kabuto has displayed enough skill with the technique to be able to deliver fatal cuts that can target vital spots, even cutting through wood and flesh with ease.\n- He could also sever the chakra pathway system, which prevented a jinchūriki from receiving chakra from their tailed-beast.\n- When enhanced with natural energy, he can even use it to sever a person’s body in half.\n- It was written as , which would usually be pronounced as \"Chakura Kaibōtō\".\n- \"Mesu\" is derived from the word \"Mes\", which is scalpel in Dutch.\n- * Shizune uses this technique as a major portion of her fighting style in the Ultimate Ninja game series.\n"

The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\n## Usage\n- His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of ninshū, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra.\n- * Zetsu's Spore Technique creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.\n- * In the anime, if the Aburame member has proper control, the kikaichū are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * Katsuyu and its summoners have a unique bond between them through Strength of a Hundred Seal and they can use Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing.\n- Sakura later used this technique to improve Obito's Kamui.\n- * Dan Katō was able to use this technique as a spirit in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and Strength of a Hundred Seal.\n- * Samehada was able to absorb and transfer chakra to its wielder.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Tsunade used this technique during Pain's invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers.\n\n## Notes\n- This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways.\n- In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.\n- Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\n- Sakura used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.\n- * Tsunade used again this technique during the five Kage's fight against Madara Uchiha to give Ōnoki some of her chakra so that he could use a massive Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique to defeat Madara's wood clones.\n- Obito did something similar to give his chakra and dōjutsu powers to Kakashi after his body had been turned to ashes.\n- * Jūgo was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's unique ability.\n- * Tailed beasts are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as Kurama has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.\n- It was also able to transfer chakra from Kisame back to Killer B.\n- * Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki was the first user of this technique to connect all humans living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.\n- Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra.\n- He gave the power to them to defeat Madara.\n- While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.\n- * In the anime, the Magaki Group uses this technique in a different way.\n- First Nangō sends his chakra to Benten and Chūshin, and then both of them send it along with its own to Akaboshi, greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.\n- He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\n"

When the sphere is activated, it generates powerful attractive force, pulling everything in the vicinity to it until a large satellite is created; users control how large the satellite becomes.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Creating a satellite apparently requires a great deal of chakra, such that Nagato, when attempting to use it through his Six Paths of Pain, must first bring the Deva Path close to his location so that he can channel his chakra to it more effectively, although it was done in his heavily exhausted state.\n- Chibaku Tensei is most often used to restrain targets, drawing them in during the satellite's creation and trapping them beneath the mounds of rubble.\n- Rather than use the satellites to restrain targets, Madara uses them as large projectiles that he drops on his opponents.\n- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Pain uses Chibaku Tensei to summon a whirlwind of boulders to protect himself against attacks.\n- *In Ultimate Ninja Impact , Pain creates the planetary body and brings it down on his opponents.\n- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution , as part of Pain and Konan's collaboration, Pain uses this technique to trap his opponent and then Konan lines the debris with explosive tags.\n\n## Notes\n- Only Naruto Uzumaki, by entering a near-Tailed Beast Mode, has been known to break free from one.\n- When performed by Sasuke Uchiha, he does not use the typical black sphere, instead gathering rubble around each of his immobilised targets; this is similar to the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei.\n- Once the satellites are formed, Sasuke is able to move them remotely.\n- Madara Uchiha is also shown creating multiple satellites at a time, each with its own black sphere.\n- In the game it is called \"Six Paths Technique\" rather than Chibaku Tensei.\n- An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called can also be performed.\n- He can also launch the boulders individually as a form of attack.\n- He also uses this as his Awakening, where he summons a whirlwind of boulders as a defensive system and an offensive system at the same time.\n- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , Nagato uses this technique to imprison his opponent, and then fires a chakra blast which goes through its core, causing a massive explosion.\n- Konan then sends a single origami bird which causes a massive explosion.\n- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Rinnegan Sasuke pierces the opponent with the black flames, traps him within Chibaku Tensei, and then destroys it with Chidori Kagutsuchi via his Complete Body — Susanoo.\n- His The Last version also uses the technique as part of his Chidori: Star Crusher.\n- And during the boss battle against Naruto and Sasuke, Madara is able to create a gargantuan version of Chibaku Tensei by merging multiple planetoids into one with the Wood Release.\n"

The process he used is explained to have initially involved the administration of imagination, and the spiritual energy which forms the basis of Yin chakra to create physical forms from nothingness.\n\n## Notes\n- Then, through the application of vitality, and the physical energy which forms the basis of Yang chakra, he would breathe life into the resulting creations.\n- The tailed beasts were created from the Ten-Tails' chakra with this technique.\n- In the anime, when using this ability, the beings created are minuscule and surrounded by a magatama-like green energy pod.\n- * According to Obito Uchiha, the Sage of the Six Paths used this ability to create many things besides the tailed beasts.\n- * During his fight with Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha merged all of the tailed beasts' chakra using Susanoo as a vessel.\n- Kurama described this act as being on par with Hagoromo's creation of the tailed beasts, except in reverse.\n"

The other being him to acquire and ingest the blood of his intended victim.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- However, he does indeed complain that it hurts like one normally does in pain, after he finished off Asuma.\n\n## Notes\n- Once ingested, his skin then turns black with white markings which makes him look like a skeleton, a symbol of absolute death.\n- This serves as the link between him and his victim.\n- Once his sacrificial ritual takes place, the victim's body is linked with Hidan's curse until he either steps or is forced out of the circle.\n- Any kind of injury that Hidan inflicts upon himself (or the injury they inflicted on him) is reciprocated on his target, be it a mere scratch to a pierce in the heart.\n- If Hidan is forced to step out of the circle, the link is temporarily broken and the victim is set free, but only as long as Hidan has stepped out of the circle's reach.\n- Basically, this technique makes Hidan a living voodoo doll.\n"

The seal was applied on the left side of the back of both Sasuke's and Anko's necks.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Anko received her cursed seal when she was a student of Orochimaru.\n- She, along with nine others, were the first people to receive a cursed seal.\n- Because she lacked the will to use it, her seal receded, and (in the anime) Orochimaru wiped her memory.\n- Orochimaru was able to briefly reactivate the seal when they fought in the Forest of Death before the Third Hokage sealed it off again.\n- Orochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal in the second phase of the Chūnin Exams, which took place in the Forest of Death.\n- Orochimaru intended to have the seal corrode Sasuke's mind so that he could become his next body.\n- Kakashi Hatake used the Evil Sealing Method to try and prevent this, but its effectiveness relied on Sasuke's choosing not to use his cursed seal.\n- Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the Sound Four.\n- When Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue.\n- During Sasuke's battle with Itachi Uchiha, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the Sword of Totsuka.\n- According to Kabuto, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto used in order to improve the binding power of Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation.\n- In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.\n\n## Notes\n- She was the only one to survive the application, establishing the one-in-ten success rate for the procedure.\n- It was fully removed when Sasuke used it as a medium to revive Orochimaru's consciousness and body via the Evil Releasing Method.\n- His eyes also turned dark grey.\n- Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose.\n- Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with snakes.\n"

Its very existence is so secret that even Orochimaru knew nothing about it.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm.\n- It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.\n- he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.\n- The target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.\n- With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.\n- He is able to make better use of the new body's arms, but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.\n- * Tō no Sho lists the Dead Demon Consuming Seal as having a range of up to five meters.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.\n\n## Notes\n- Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.\n- While the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,\n* When Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.\n- instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.\n- Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.\n- Souls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using .\n- To use, an individual wears the Shinigami Mask, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami.\n- If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed.\n- However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again.\n- With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.\n- When Minato uses it against the Nine-Tails, he does so from significantly further away.\n- * During his discussion with Kushina on how to deal with the Nine-Tails, Minato stated: .\n- What he meant by this is unclear.\n"

The energy is a mixture of sound waves and airwaves, with the ratio between the two differing depending on what Zaku intends to use this technique for; for example, 100% airwaves and 0% sound waves is enough to shatter stone.\n\n## Usage\n- It can be used with both hands towards a single purpose, which in certain cases qualifies as Extreme Decapitating Airwaves.\n\n## Notes\n- In other uses, it can repel incoming projectiles, soften the ground for use as a cushion, and knock over people.\n- Its power weakens sharply over distances.\n- Despite how useful this technique is and how easy it is for Zaku to perform, the tubes in his arms represent a serious vulnerability: if the openings of the tubes are blocked when Zaku tries to use it, the energy won't be able to get out and will burst from his elbows, severing them from his body.\n"

The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra.\n\n## Usage\n- After the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed.\n- This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work.\n\n## Notes\n- Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part.\n- The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body.\n- This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison.\n- As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency.\n- This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate.\n- To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\n- This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery.\n- Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin.\n"

It allows the user to put their opponent under an illusion using only words and speech.\n\n## Notes\n- By infusing chakra into the tongue of the user, any target within auditory range of the user will become easily swayed in a post-hypnotic trance of their will and self-assurance; forcing them to face their innermost trauma as realised by the user's words in an effort to mentally break their spirit.\n- Once told to look behind their back the genjutsu becomes complete, causing them to as an obedient follower of the user.\n- The illusion itself cannot be easily broken, even when the person is under realisation that the genjutsu is in effect, but strong emotional connections, like love, can help in dispelling it.\n- Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely.\n- Likewise, echoes and acoustics that enhance the user's voice can make the genjutsu more effective to sway the target.\n- * Kankurō indirectly references this from Gaara's Tale DLC in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 .\n"

According to Obito, this binding power is far greater than that of Nagato's Outer Path.\n\n## Usage\n- When Madara retrieved his Rinnegan and took control of the statue, he used it to produce chains with tips shaped like a dragon's head.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The chains possess a cursed seal that suppresses the power of tailed beasts, and also cause a great deal of pain to their victims.\n- By manifesting chains from the jinchūriki's receivers and connecting them to his hand, he was able to bind and suppress the tailed beasts inside them in the event that they resisted his control.\n- The beasts were also bound by chains within their consciousness; when the receivers were removed from their jinchūriki's bodies, these chains were replaced by a single larger chain connecting directly to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, permitting Obito to quickly reseal them into the statue.\n- These chains were able to quickly restrain and seal all nine tailed beasts by wrapping around their necks like collars and dragging them into the statue.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- He implanted a single receiver into each of his Six Paths of Pain, which were made into temporary jinchūriki.\n\n## Notes\n- Obito was able to generate these chains through the use of black receivers.\n- The Demonic Statue itself is able to emit chakra chains from its mouth.\n- The chains are also capable of extracting tailed beasts from their jinchūriki, as well as preventing them from cancelling their Tailed Beast Mode.\n- In the event that they are severed, these chains can easily be reconnected.\n"

The chains move very fast, able to bypass Gaara's Shield of Sand, which is known for its speed.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The technique can be countered.\n- If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them.\n- Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinchūriki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinchūriki's immobilisation and causing them pain.\n- There is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however.\n\n## Notes\n- Once latched on to the target's body and chakra network, the chains will use the tenketsu located at the navel to reach their way to the tailed beast and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the jinchūriki.\n- Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock.\n- However, if another jinchūriki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.\n- Techniques that suppress chakra absorption such as a cocoon made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained.\n- The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by closing the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\n"

The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines.\n\n## Usage\n- Kakō has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).\n\n## Notes\n- The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust.\n- Because it attacks at a molecular level, there is no conventional defence against this technique.\n- The resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure.\n- For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage.\n- However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an entire island.\n- Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad wood clones in an instant.\n- This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.\n- When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.\n- The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it.\n- According to Ōnoki, the differences in shape demonstrated by the users of this technique is reflective of the generational gap between them.\n- variant.\n- Mu using Jinton.png| variant.\n"

The kick serves two simultaneous purposes: as a surprise attack, as an act of self-sacrifice, with the user's exaggerated stance, confident expression, and the sheer inconceivableness of the attack combining to intimidate the opponent, in the process enhancing the kick's offensive potential.\n\n## Notes\n- Because the kick's effectiveness very much relies on appearance, any faltering of resolve will weaken it: when Might Guy realizes mid-flight that he's attacking Jiraiya, an ally, his surprise causes his kick to do less damage than it otherwise would have.\n"

He was capable of sewing up any injuries that he or others might suffer, commonly by reattaching body parts; this ability seems to instantly reattach even nerves and muscles, as the patients could instantly move their limbs without any other complex procedures right away.\n\n## Notes\n- However, it appears that this ability is somewhat limited, as he warned Hidan not to move his head too much after he had sewed it back on, saying that it might fall off again.\n- He could detach parts of his limbs and then manipulate them, to the point that he could even send them underground and then reattach them when he was done with them.\n- The most significant aspect of these threads is that they granted Kakuzu a form of immortality, although he declined to think of it that way.\n- In addition to sewing up his injuries, he could use the threads to tear into a victim's body, steal their still functioning organs, and integrate them into his own body, thus extending his life.\n- Kakuzu usually used this method to steal hearts from powerful shinobi, and was able to store up to four spare hearts in his body at any given time, meaning that all hearts must stop functioning in order for Kakuzu to die.\n- He can also put one of those hearts into his limbs and have them move individually, as seen when he used his hand to remove a shadow-enhanced chakra blades that prevented the rest of his body from moving.\n- He could detach these masks and have them take on a body of their own, composed entirely of threads.\n- Ino Yamanaka commented the masks gave off a bad chakra.\n- These masks were capable of attacking separately, unleashing devastating blasts of elemental chakra.\n- These threads could also compact together to form a spider-like body around Kakuzu, allowing him to fuse the attacks of his masks together in order to increase his attacking power.\n- Kakuzu's animal masks contained his spare hearts.\n- If he took use of the heart for himself, the corresponding mask would shatter upon the creature's reentry into Kakuzu's body.\n- * Fire mask: This heart had a fire-affinity, and took on the shape of a demonic tiger.\n- It could use Fire Release: Intelligent Hard Work.\n- This mask could also unite with the Wind mask to launch a fire-wind dual strike that was near unstoppable.\n- * Lightning mask: This heart had a lightning-affinity, and took on the shape of some sort of deformed bipedal.\n- It could use Lightning Release: False Darkness.\n- * Water mask: This heart had an water-affinity, and took on the shape of a demonic, beaked bipedal.\n- It allowed Kakuzu to use Water Release techniques, although they were not seen as the mask was destroyed before Kakuzu could use any.\n- * Wind mask: This heart had a wind-affinity, and took on a strange four-legged body with thin wings.\n- It could use Wind Release: Pressure Damage.\n- It could unite with the Fire mask to launch a fire-wind dual strike that was near unstoppable.\n- The name Jiongu was taken from the [http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/MSN-02_Zeong Mobile Suit MSN-02] , a mecha that can detach its arms for ranged attacks, while still attached to the main body with wires.\n- The name was altered slightly and given kanji to create the name of this technique.\n- * In the manga, when Kakuzu is explaining his ability to store hearts, he is seen with a single horned mask on his back not matching the design of any of other masks.\n- The colour and element of this mask is unknown.\n"

Normally, individuals can use no more than 20% of their body's full potential, the brain's way of protecting the individual from harming their body through overexertion.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Opening the gate on this occasion also causes Lee's nose to start bleeding.\n- After opening this gate, Guy's muscle fibers rupture, causing him intense pain if anyone touches him.\n\n## Notes\n- With training, individuals can learn to remove these limiters, referred to as \"opening\" the gates.\n- With each opened gate, individuals are given access to more and more of their body's chakra, thus increasing their physical strength and speed.\n- Since Madara's era, there have only been a few known users:\n* Might Duy learned to open all Eight Gates after twenty years of extensive training.\n- * Might Guy, Duy's son, was taught how to open all Eight Gates by his father.\n- By adulthood, Lee had mastered all eight gates.\n- * In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Rock Lee and the Suicide Corps could open the Sixth Gate to use a collaboration technique called the Crane Wing Formation.\n- * In the anime, Metal Lee, Rock Lee's son, is shown subconsciously opening the first gate.\n- * Kakashi Hatake is seemingly able to open the first gate, as seen when he activates it during a Cliff Climbing Practice.\n- The anime later shows him opening it explicitly.\n- Learning to open any of the Eight Gates is apparently very difficult, as Kakashi is surprised when he's told that Lee - only thirteen years old at the time - can open five gates; Kakashi notes that such an accomplishment is impossible through hard work alone.\n- Part of Kakashi's surprise is also because he does not believe it was wise for Guy to teach Lee to open the gates in the first place: although opening the gates does briefly give the user power greater than what they're normally capable of, this increased power causes the user serious harm.\n- When opening the eighth and final gate, users will die as a consequence, their bodies being unable to survive the immense amounts of chakra flowing through them.\n- Because of this, Duy developed a self-rule to dictate when it was acceptable to open any of the Eight Gates, a rule he passed to Guy, Rock Lee has also been known to use the Eight Gates to defend his nindō, the dream by which he leads his life.\n- To have all of the Eight Gates open at once is known as Eight Gates Released Formation.\n- # The is located on the spinal cord.\n- Rock Lee opens this gate as he's about to use the Reverse Lotus, seemingly to increase his speed; as he performs the Reverse Lotus, his muscles start to tear.\n- # The , located in the stomach, increases all the user's abilities.\n- The power that emanates from the user is enough to displace surrounding bodies of water.\n- # The is located at the heart.\n- Users open this gate by puncturing their chest with their thumb in order to direct the chakra there.\n- * After Might Guy opens all Eight Gates, he is saved from death by Naruto Uzumaki's Yin–Yang Release.\n"

A stronger seal is created if two Four Symbols Seal are used; this is called the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's chakra to merge with whoever they've been sealed into.\n- Minato Namikaze used the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style to seal the Nine-Tails into his infant son, Naruto Uzumaki.\n- Before Minato performed the seal, he summoned a ceremonial altar that he placed Naruto on.\n- Naruto's seal is located on his abdomen, but only becomes visible when he uses the Nine-Tails' chakra.\n- As an additional safety measure, Minato also sealed the chakra of himself and Naruto's mother, Kushina Uzumaki, into Naruto, who would appear before him under certain circumstances: Minato appears when the Nine-Tails nearly convinces Naruto to remove the seal, stops him from going through with it, and then reinforces the seal; Kushina appears when Naruto is trying to replace the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style with a new seal, and gives him the support he needs to tame the Nine-Tails.\n- After this key is passed to Naruto, he uses it to remove the seal in preparation for replacing it with a stronger one.\n- * In the manga, after transferring the chakra of Kurama's Yin-half into an incapacitated Naruto Uzumaki, Obito Uchiha was also shown reestablishing this seal.\n- * In the anime, Orochimaru suited Mecha-Naruto with this seal in order to take the Nine-Tails from Naruto.\n\n## Notes\n- When Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways.\n- The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising.\n- The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them, but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.\n- The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.\n- When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.\n"

Unlike clone techniques that only appear to be similar, the ability is instead a physical separation and so does not require hand seals to activate, making it faster in comparison as a result.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Because the duplicates cannot be dispelled like normal clones, they will be unable to reunite if one is sealed.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- This poses a great risk to Mū as his chakra reserves are also halved in the process.\n\n## Notes\n- This also means that even if one is incapacitated, the other remains completely unaffected as neither can truly be regarded as the original.\n- In doing so, he is left unable to use more taxing techniques like his Dust Release kekkei tōta.\n"

      "markdown": "# Flying Thunder God Technique\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu\n- Class: Supplementary\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Minato Namikaze, Tobirama Senju\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie\n\n## Summary\nThe Flying Thunder God Technique is a space–time ninjutsu originally developed by Tobirama Senju. It was later recreated by Boruto Uzumaki.\n\n## Usage\n- Together, they develop the Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique, which allows them to switch places with each other in combat to set-up different manoeuvres.\n- During their lives, both developed their own variants of the Flying Thunder God: Tobirama had the Flying Thunder God Slash, which he used to stab opponents the instant he teleported to their side; Minato had Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder, which created a barrier in front of him that teleported incoming attacks to a different location.\n- Though it produces nearly identical results it is technically different enough to be considered an entirely separate technique, and has more limitations.\n- * In video games, Minato's use of the Flying Thunder God Technique creates a yellow flash, in reference to his nickname.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- During the Third Shinobi World War, Minato's extensive usage of the Flying Thunder God led to his moniker as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\": Minato's ability to dodge A's Lightning Release Chakra Mode led A to dub Minato the fastest ninja who ever lived.\n- This may suggest the reasoning as to why the technique is restricted towards a seal, because lightning is attracted to lightning rods.\n- * The Flying Thunder God Technique has sometimes been referred to as the Body Flicker Technique,\n* Although it's been said that the technique formula can't be removed, its marking has disappeared from individuals that have tailed beasts sealed into them and extracted from them.\n- Tobirama's is more reminiscent of the formula used for seals – a random assortment of Kanji, Hindi script, and other symbols.\n\n## Notes\n- There is no limit to how many targets can be marked with technique formulas, as Minato Namikaze routinely uses dozens at a time.\n- By entering a dimensional void, users can instantly teleport to a technique formula's location whenever they please, regardless of distance, or different dimension.\n- To an onlooker, it may look like the Body Flicker Technique, but the Flying Thunder God actually has more in common with the Summoning Technique.\n- but this requires additional chakra to do; particularly large objects can require so much chakra as to place a limit on how far away the user is able to teleport.\n- Users can choose to teleport to a different location than the objects, or they can teleport objects without teleporting themselves.\n- In combat situations, the Flying Thunder God can most effectively be used by marking an opponent's body with the technique formula, allowing the user to teleport to them at anytime: when the marked opponent tries to attack, the user can attack them first; Tō no Sho likens this to a juinjutsu, in that anyone marked with the technique formula is essentially sentenced to death.\n- Both Tobirama and Minato were famed as the fastest shinobi during their lifetimes.\n- While both were very fast on their own, the Flying Thunder God also contributed to their fame.\n- When both Tobirama and Minato are revived during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tobirama was able to link himself with Minato's Flying Thunder God network, allowing him to teleport to the latter's technique formulas.\n- Approximately two decades later, Boruto Uzumaki would take inspiration from his grandfather and use his inherent Ōtsutsuki teleportation ability to devise an imitation of the ninjutsu.\n- * In the anime, Minato's technique formula appears to say 忍愛之剣, made up of the kanji for , , , and .\n- * Originally, before Tobirama's second revival, the Flying Thunder God technique was said to be Minato's original technique, but it was then retconned to him learning it.\n"

It inflicts internal damage through attacking the body's Chakra Pathway System, subsequently injuring organs which are closely intertwined with the area of the network which has been struck.\n\n## Usage\n- By employing the use of the Byakugan, an experienced user can target the tenketsu, thus enhancing the havoc and control a Gentle Fist practitioner can impose upon an opponent's chakra network.\n- This allows the practitioner a wider range of motion and full use of momentum, without giving his or her opponent much of a chance for a direct strike.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- These 361 nodes are key gate-keeping interceptions in the chakra circulatory network, thus forcibly opening or sealing them in whatever manner the Gentle Fist user sees fit, is a powerful tactical option to have.\n- In the novel, it was shown that one can even use the Gentle Fist to counter enemy technique, carefully cutting an attack two so that it passes by harmlessly.\n\n## Notes\n- To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own chakra into the opponent's chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system.\n- Even the slightest tap can cause severe internal damage, hence the name \"gentle\" fist.\n- The affected person's chakra flow can either be increased or disrupted completely, preventing them from using techniques as seen in Neji's fight with Hinata during the Chūnin Exams, rendering her own Gentle Fist manoeuvres ineffective.\n- Neji Hyūga noted that any chakra-based substance can be destroyed by this technique.\n- As seen in his fight with Kidōmaru, it is done by leaking chakra from the chakra openings in one's hands and moulding it into a needle-like shape to slice through the chakra.\n- In contrast, Kidōmaru managed to devise a method that prevented the chakra from being injected into the body, thus negating the main impact of the Gentle Fist through physical contact.\n- Because Gentle Fist is mostly taijutsu, some believed users can only emit chakra from their hands due to the hands being the most mobile limbs on the body.\n- However, users can emit chakra from any tenketsu, making binding them with chakra-based substance impossible.\n- Being a close-quarter combat style, Gentle Fist practitioners have a disadvantage against long-range fighters, as Kidōmaru took full advantage of his distance weaponry to overwhelm Neji.\n- Because the chakra pathway system is invisible to the naked eye, the Byakugan is required for most techniques of this style.\n- Since the Byakugan is unique to the Hyūga clan, it has become their signature style of combat.\n- The ability to inflict severe internal trauma with minimal external force, combined with chakra network manipulation, makes the Gentle Fist the most reputable and fearsome taijutsu style known in all of Konohagakure.\n- In contrast to this, the technique can also be used for supplementary purposes displayed when Hinata used the technique to fix Naruto Uzumaki's dislocated shoulder joint during the Fourth Shinobi World War.\n- Due to their possession of the Byakugan, the Ōtsutsuki clan also practices this taijutsu form, though far more aggressive than what the Hyūga clan practices.\n- Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki demonstrated his while fighting Naruto Uzumaki, targeting Naruto's tenketsu and internal organs to try to incapacitate him.\n- * Techniques from this line have also been called or .\n- Kenpō is also a popular Japanese term for Chinese martial arts.\n- ** Although the supposed reading of is \"Jūkenpō\" due to constant-conversion, in the name of this technique according to furigana it is \"Jūkenhō\".\n- * This fighting style might have also been based on Touch of Death, in which moves seemingly less lethal can be made lethal by striking certain pressure points on the body, a reference to how this technique targets the Chakra Pathway System and tenketsu of an individual to explosively increase the damage done.\n- * Sasuke Uchiha imitates this style in Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu .\n"

Sasuke Uchiha remarked that it came close to replicating Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's secret techniques.\n\n## Usage\n- It also allows the user to create snake-like creatures out of dark chakra, which can be used in battle or parasitically attached to individuals suffering from negative emotions to continually drain their chakra, further disturbing their mental state.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The seal is comprised of Hashirama Senju's cells and must be surgically implanted into a compatible vessel, a process which drains a great deal of the caster's vitality, shortening their lifespan; Tanuki died right after he cast it onto his daughter.\n- The seal itself acts as a gateway to a separate dimension that Tanuki called the , wherein dwells a legendary beast named Nue that is born the moment the seal is completed.\n- The mark acts as a medium for absorbed chakra to be transferred into the Nue, nourishing it, as well as a gate through which it can be summoned.\n- As Nue is fed chakra, the seal's pattern spreads and the beast quickly grows into a gigantic monster, eventually becoming a living chakra bomb that can be summoned to a location and detonated, creating an explosion large enough to destroy an entire city.\n- As the true source of power for this technique is negative emotions, if the vessel overcomes these emotions the seal will be destroyed.\n- When Sumire Kakei achieved this, a portion of the seal remained and migrated to her palm, allowing her to maintain her symbiotic bond with Nue.\n\n## Notes\n- The principal usage of the Gozu Tennō is to send the host into enemy territory to release Nue, who will rampage as much as possible before detonating to wipe out everything, including the host.\n- Incidentally, both cases had Konoha as their targets.\n"

The user produces the kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its jinchūriki with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.\n\n## Usage\n- When Hashirama used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinchūriki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the tailed beast control through his Wood Release: Wood Human Technique, which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast controlled by the Sharingan.\n\n## Notes\n- When Yamato used this technique to suppress Naruto Uzumaki's four-tailed form, Naruto needed to be in possession of the First Hokage's Necklace to aid in suppressing the Nine-Tails' chakra.\n- It comes from a saying by Confucius, , that is most commonly translated long the lines of \"At sixty, my ear was obedient\", meaning that at age sixty, one is able to hear all things without being unhappy about them.\n- The last part of this technique's name, , comes from a famous series of short poems and accompanying images, called the .\n- The pictures and poems are intended to illustrate the stages of Zen discipline.\n- They were drawn by a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master called .\n- The tenth poem talks about how the fully-enlightened herdsman returns to the city to help others reach enlightenment.\n- This poem is called , which can be translated as \"entering society with bliss-bringing hands\" (i.e.\n- hands that teach how to reach enlightenment).\n- As a gag, the kanji on Yamato's hand changed to , as he was on the verge of vomiting.\n"

Members of the clan's main house brand members of the clan's branch houses with the cursed seal so that, when they die, their Byakugan will be sealed away, preventing its secrets from being learned by enemies.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The cursed seal can also be used by the main house to torture branch house members: if a main house member uses a special hand seal, the branch house member will experience intense pain, discouraging them from disobeying the main house again.\n- If the pain is great enough, it can even kill the branch house member,\n\nMembers of the branch house are branded with the cursed seal on the third birthday of the clan's next heir or heiress, regardless of their own age at the time: Neji received his when he was only four years old, when Hinata turned three.\n- Cursed seals are placed on the recipient's forehead, for which reason they tend to keep it covered, such as with their forehead protector.\n- Neji for years struggled with the idea that his cursed seal binds him to a life of servitude to the main house, likening his fate to that of a caged bird; because the cursed seal only disappears at the time of death, dying would be the only way he could be free.\n- Because the inverted form (卐) is commonly associated with Nazism outside of Asia, the anime instead uses an \"X\" for the cursed seal, to avoid confusion.\n- It's unclear how he was able to avoid the effects of the juinjutsu, whether his victim was a main house member, or the Byakugan being removed from a branch house member before death, whether the cursed seal prevents this is unknown.\n\n## Notes\n- Viz's monthly distribution of the English manga makes the same alteration, but their volume compilations use the original design.\n- Whenever the original design is shown, Viz makes sure to explain that it is not a swastika.\n- * Ao from Kirigakure killed a member of the Hyūga clan to obtain a single Byakugan.\n- Like the Hyūga, Ao takes steps to protect his Byakugan from theft.\n"

The linear motion and force applied to draw the sword from the scabbard results in slashes that are faster and stronger than ones executed with the sword already drawn.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The speed at which these techniques can be executed — the initial strike in particular — is such, that when performed by a skilled user, it can prevent enemy shinobi from forming hand seals (and thus ninjutsu), by exploiting the small opening that these movements create.\n\n## Notes\n- This makes them highly effective against most shinobi and potentially, those of even Hanzō's calibre, if performed by someone such as Mifune who has mastered the style.\n"

The exact method of achieving this varies from user to user: in the anime Kaguya Ōtsutsuki uses Yomotsu Hirasaka to create a portal to a dimension containing a moon; Obito Uchiha produces the Ten-Tails and transforms it into a construct of the God Tree, which has a Rinne Sharingan within the blooming flower at its top; Madara Uchiha, per his Eye of the Moon Plan, flies into the sky and reflects his own Rinne Sharingan off of the moon.\n\n## Usage\n- A Rinnegan user can block the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, saving themselves and those within their range from its control.\n- * In the anime, Kankurō creates the ultimate puppet, which is a giant transforming robot.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Should these be possessed by two different people, they must form the rat hand seal together in order to release the technique.\n\n## Notes\n- Once cast, the penetrating light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi shines across the world, bright enough to dispel the night for as long as it is active.\n- All those who fall under its gaze are trapped in the genjutsu, with the Rinnegan's design appearing in their eyes to represent its influence.\n- Victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are rendered immobile so long as they are under its effects, allowing them to easily be wrapped by the bark of the God Tree's roots using God: Nativity of a World of Trees.\n- Over the course of years, humans connected to the tree in this manner are gradually drained of their life energy, personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into White Zetsu while at the same time, producing a new Chakra Fruit in the process.\n- The user can also draw upon the chakra of those bound to the tree, causing it to erupt from the ground and enter their own body.\n- In the anime, the technique seemed to need perfecting as Kaguya discovered in her first usage: most of those trapped in Infinite Tsukuyomi such as Haori died after being trapped in the genjutsu instead of being converted into White Zetsu.\n- Certain individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- The dead, such as those brought back with the Impure World Reincarnation, are impervious to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- White Zetsu, Black Zetsu, and those whose body Black Zetsu coats are also unaffected.\n- In fact, Rinnegan users, through the combination with the chakra of the nine tailed beasts, are the only ones capable of ending the Infinite Tsukuyomi and releasing those trapped within its dreams.\n- Only a select few of these dreams have been seen:\n* Hinata Hyūga is in a strong and happy relationship with Naruto Uzumaki.\n- Neji Hyūga is also alive and watching her from afar with Hanabi Hyūga.\n- * Kiba Inuzuka is a Hokage, a position he uses to declare a national holiday for dogs.\n- Also, in the anime, all citizens of the village are to have a dog as a pet/partner.\n- * Shino Aburame discovers and tames a giant new insect species to ride.\n- * Chōji Akimichi has a wife who feeds him and loves him for his appetite.\n- Chōza Akimichi is proud of his son.\n- * Shikamaru Nara decides to never get married to which Temari agrees.\n- Asuma Sarutobi and Shikaku Nara are also alive and enjoying their respective families.\n- * Ino Yamanaka is loved by Sasuke Uchiha and Sai who fight for her affection.\n- Inoichi Yamanaka is alive and proud of his daughter.\n- * Rock Lee wins the love of Sakura Haruno by defeating Naruto and Neji in a fight.\n- * Tenten is a member of a complete and mature Team Guy.\n- In the anime, everyone she knows have polar-opposite personalities and she is a famed weapons master.\n- Furthermore, as Tenten had made direct contact with the Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths just before being caught, she retained her memories of the war and was fully aware that she was inside a dream world.\n- * Mei Terumī gets married, with the other Kage attending the ceremony.\n- In the anime, Chōjūrō and Ao attend her marriage.\n- * Tsunade lives in a Konoha where none of her loved ones died and none of her friends turned against the village while Dan became the Hokage.\n- Furthermore, in the anime, Konoha's peace and prosperity prompts Jiraiya to write a book about it.\n- * Gaara has a happy childhood with his parents, siblings, and uncle and he gets to play with Naruto whenever he wants.\n- * In the anime, Yamato becomes the official leader of Team 7 (which includes Sasuke) and is respected throughout Konoha.\n- * In the anime, Killer B goes on an adventure with his fellow jinchūriki and their tailed beasts, saving a princess from Akatsuki.\n- * In the anime, Karin gets revenge on Zōsui and has Sasuke, who is the Hokage, smile kindly at her again.\n- * In the anime, Sai learns to

See talkpage for more info. -->\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Game\n\n## Summary\nIzanagi is a genjutsu performed with the Sharingan. In the anime, users are shown extending Izanagi's influence beyond their personal reality, affecting their surroundings and those within it.\n\n## Usage\n- In exchange for the brief control over reality that Izanagi grants them, the Sharingan that they perform it with becomes blind; Because the Uchiha prized their Sharingan, to lose it in this way prompted them to label it kinjutsu.\n- Obito Uchiha, because he has control over the Senju cells he uses, is able to keep a single Izanagi active for significantly longer than Danzō.\n- * In the Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm series, Danzō uses this as part of his ultimate technique, letting his Wood Release go out of control, creating a tree that crushes both himself and the opponent, and activating Izanagi at the last moment to escape unharmed.\n\n## Notes\n- Izanagi is based on the Creation of All Things Technique, used by the Sage of Six Paths to turn imagination into reality.\n- The process is explained to use spiritual energy – which forms the basis of Yin Release – to create shape from nothingness.\n- Then, through the application of physical energy – which forms the basis of Yang Release – the shape has life breathed into it.\n- Members of the Uchiha clan, as descendants of the Sage, perform Izanagi with their Sharingan.\n- Because Uchiha only possess half of the Sage's chakra, they can only keep Izanagi active for a few seconds; allowing him to use Izanagi for one minute.\n- As this is still not very long, he has ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm, giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi with breaks in between as he chooses.\n- Since he is not an Uchiha, each use of Izanagi causes Danzō's chakra to drop significantly.\n- As with other Sharingan-based techniques, Izanagi can be programmed to activate under certain conditions.\n- Madara Uchiha did so to undo his death after he'd been entombed, restoring him to life unbeknownst to anyone.\n- In this case, it is Izanagi, who, together with his sister and wife Izanami, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\n- One of the most famous stories about Izanagi tells the tale of how he goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve Izanami after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, Kagutsuchi.\n- In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape.\n- Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form.\n- Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave.\n- Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day.\n- In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day.\n- In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\n- After his failed attempt to get Izanami, he washed himself in a stream.\n- As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n- Like Izanagi, Izanami also blinds the Sharingan that it is performed with.\n- * During initial depictions of Izanagi, the blindness it causes is represented by the eye's lids closing.\n- After the blindness caused by Izanami is depicted as turning the eye a blank white, Izanagi starts being depicted the same way.\n- * Despite Madara using a time-activated Izanagi in the manga, he is not listed as a user of Izanagi in Jin no Sho .\n"

Like its counterpart, in exchange for the temporary ability that it grants the user, the Sharingan with which Izanami is cast is rendered blind and loses its light forever.\n\n## Usage\n- In the anime, it's shown that there is no other way to undo this technique even by someone who has complete control over their chakra.\n\n## Notes\n- According to Itachi, this technique and Izanagi form a pair, but unlike the latter, which is a technique capable of altering destiny, Izanami is instead one that \" decides \" it.\n- The user must then intentionally replicate the same sensation and in the same way, memorise that instant with their Sharingan (represented as: A ).\n- Izanami overlaps and connects these two identical bodily sensations (A and A'), as well as the flow of time between them, creating an infinite loop of events that entraps the opponent's consciousness.\n- The user can also use their Sharingan to remember multiple sensations, (represented as B, C, and so forth) and those sensations will also be used when Izanami is activated.\n- The user also doesn't need necessarily to replicate A with A' to initiate Izanami.\n- They can also replicate B with B' or C with C' as well.\n- The more sensations they memorise, the better their chances would be to initiate Izanami on a person and the more sensations the victim will experience each time they repeat a loop.\n- Each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage incurred is reset as it were before the start of the loop, although the remains of severed appendages do not disappear.\n- The illusion of the user and anyone they were fighting alongside also have any damage reset as well such as the blindness that comes with Izanami.\n- Despite being able to become consciously aware of their situation and act differently, the victim is unable to significantly alter or escape from the inevitable progression of these events as the illusions they're fighting will also quickly adapt to their changes in order to force the victim to experience the memorised sensations.\n- However, because this technique was created to reprimand and save the users of Izanagi, the victim is able to escape the infinite loop if they can acknowledge the real results of their actions and in doing so, accept their fate.\n- The illusion of the caster also seems to be sentient as the illusionary Itachi was shown to be shaking his head when Kabuto futilely tried to undo the technique without accepting his fate first.\n- The illusion of the user and anyone they're fighting alongside also repeats their verbal actions such as the illusionary Itachi telling the illusionary Sasuke not to leave his side, an action Itachi did to Sasuke.\n- The illusion of the user will continuously tell the victim to take a closer look at them and acknowledge their mistakes until they do so.\n- Whilst this resulted in little issue if only one person were using Izanagi, if there were two or more casters, they would begin to fight amongst each other over personally favourable outcomes.\n- Thus, as dōjutsu users were unlikely to succumb to ocular genjutsu, Izanami was created as a method to reprimand such clansmen, as well as save them from their own arrogance.\n- By imprisoning them within an unalterable loop of events, the victim was forced to accept the reality they had created if they ever wished to escape the illusion.\n- However, because of the dangers involved in using a technique with a built-in escape route in a real battle, Izanami became classed as a kinjutsu.\n- As such, Izanami is ironically not a genjutsu to be used on an enemy, but on a friend who has lost their way as a means of helping them find themselves again.\n- In this case, it is Izanami, who, together with her brother and husband Izanagi, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\n- One of the most famous stories about Izanami tells the tale of how Izanagi goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve her after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, Kagutsuchi.\n- In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape.\n- Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form.\n- Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave.\n- Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day.\n- In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day.\n- In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\n- After his failed attempt to get Izanami, Izanagi washed himself in a stream.\n- As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n"

Over time, the Kāma will gradually overwrite the vessel's genetic profile until they transform into a perfect Ōtsutsuki.\n\n## Usage\n- At the same time, a non-suitable vessel can be used to perform an imperfect resurrection of the Ōtsutsuki.\n- The second time, he spoke only in his voice, Boruto's voice only being heard when he began to take back control of his body.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Should the Ōtsutsuki be slain, their soul will migrate to one of their vessels and become anchored to the world of the living, and when the Kāma completes, will through their body, completely replacing them.\n- In the interim, the vessel can learn to activate the Kāma and utilise a portion of the Ōtsutsuki's power and abilities, and if reincarnation has not yet been achieved, the soul of the slain Ōtsutsuki can even manifest and temporarily take control over their body.\n- Occasionally, an unsuitable vessel will survive the ritual, however, producing a unique variant of the seal called the .\n- Kāma may produce a variety of different patterns depending on the individual, where on their body it is embedded, and what abilities are being accessed.\n- As its name implies, the White Kāma is white in colour rather than black, and its markings may also shimmer and glow with a particular colour too when activated (grey in Code's case).\n- Kawaki's Kāma.png|Kawaki's transformation.\n- Jigen : Isshiki embedded his Kāma into Jigen's chin while parasitically fused with his brain, after being betrayed and nearly killed by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki.\n- Despite the Kāma being fully decompressed, Jigen could not manifest Isshiki's Kokugan nor Byakugan.\n- This Kāma served its purpose and vanished when Isshiki was forced to reincarnate through Jigen's body.\n- Kawaki : Upon realising that Jigen's body would not be able to sustain his chakra, Isshiki transferred his Kāma into Kawaki's left palm through scientific experiments and a ritual conducted with the aid of Amado Sanzu.\n- He lost this Kāma when Isshiki resurrected via Jigen's body, but later it was secretly reapplied by Amado while restoring Kawaki's right arm, for it to function purely as a weapon after Isshiki's soul vanished.\n- Isshiki's Kāma in Kawaki was estimated to be 80% extracted prior to its removal.\n- By the first battle against Code, the Kāma was advanced enough let Kawaki access Isshiki's raw power and various abilities, including Isshiki's dōjutsu.\n- As such he bears a White Kāma, which is located on his left palm.\n- As Code is not a vessel, his Kāma did not vanish upon Isshiki's revival into Jigen's body, and before his soul expired, Isshiki entrusted Code with carrying on the Ōtsutsuki's will and bade him to become a complete Ōtsutsuki by sacrificing either Boruto or Kawaki to Ten-Tails and feeding upon the resulting God Tree's chakra fruit.\n- Upon facing Code, Momoshiki's Kāma in Boruto had reached 82% extracted.\n- These enhanced combat abilities and power exist for the sake of protecting the Kāma's vessel.\n- Kāma can also be used as a medium for Space-Time Ninjutsu, transforming the mark on their palm into a symbol resembling their horn pattern and opening a rift to any location, including foreign dimensions.\n- If one properly draws on their Kāma, they can overlay the accumulated with their mind and body, instantly becoming a seasoned fighter.\n- According to Code, this is the true essence of Kāma and grants the user an exponential increase in battle power, well beyond that conferred by the enhanced physical abilities alone.\n- With enough experience, the user can progress the Kāma to a more powerful state, gaining access to the Ōtsutsuki's unique powers, including their Shinjutsu.\n- Isshiki and Amado theorised that it was this resonance that allowed both Kawaki's and Boruto's Kāma to mature more rapidly than expected.\n- Although Jigen is able to synchronise with Kawaki's Kāma to open a space-time rift, no such resonance exist between the two of them as Kawaki did not experience the sudden growth until his contact with Boruto.\n- This resonance also often caused Boruto's Kāma to activate involuntarily when Kawaki activated his own.\n- In order to maintain control in such instances they must attempt to minimise the amount of chakra they absorb to prevent the vessel from awakening.\n- This is the true purpose of Kāma, and allows the Ōtsutsuki to transcend death.\n- Even if the vessel's body dies and is severely damaged and/or not fully compatible with the Ōtsutsuki, or the Ōtsutsuki is only partially manifested, so long as it exists and still bears Kāma, it will remain viable for the Ōtsutsuki to resurrect through, in which any damage it has suffered will be healed.\n- With the aid of technology developed by Amado Sanzu, Isshiki was able to transfer his Kāma to other individuals using Jigen as an intermediary, albeit with a low rate of success, as of fifteen known test subjects, thirteen are confirmed to have died, with Kawaki the only known successful recipient.\n- Amado wants Kawaki to use a similar method to embed a Kāma containing the biological data of his daughter, Akebi Sanzu, into a clone of her in order to facilitate her resurrection.\n- Amado noted that there is no known way of removing a Kāma from a vessel, nor to stop its takeover, aside from killing the vessel before the resurrection process completes itself; even the very Ōtsutsuki who placed the seal onto the vessel cannot control the automatic transfer.\n- However, the Kāma's final process of resurrection will not occur so long as the Ōtsutsuki in question is still alive, hence Isshiki was not reborn through Jigen's body despite the Kāma already having extracted all the data into Jigen's body.\n- Upon being resurrected, should there be any other Kāma implanted by the same Ōtsutsuki, those additional Kāma will simultaneously be erased.\n- However, despite the Kāma's erasure, any Ōtsutsuki data that was already extracted will remain so.\n- Also, White Kāma will not disappear if an Ōtsutsuki resurrects via a complete Kāma.\n- Alternatively, the soul of the Ōtsutsuki can alter the remaining programming of their Kāma to rebuild the vessel's body once, saving their soul but cancelling the resurrection.\n- Though untested, Kawaki hypothesises that he and Boruto may be able to produce Kāma of their own, as they have each already had in excess of 80% of their body overwritten by Ōtsutsuki genetic data.\n- Kawaki also theorises that Code, bearer of a White Kāma, would be an ideal candidate for Boruto to use as a vessel, as Code proved himself being compatible to survive the process while not being anyone's vessel.\n- Amado claims to be able to restore Kawaki's Kāma, which would restore his access to the Ōtsutsuki powers in his body without the drawback of being taken over by Isshiki, as his soul has vanished.\n- As this requires sacrificing a percentage of the compressed data in their Kāma, it makes it impossible for them to fully overwrite the cells of their vessel, and thus unable to complete their resurrection.\n- When applying a Kāma normally, it seems to have no detrimental effects on the potential vessel, whether they are compatible or not, as neither Jigen nor Boruto suffer any negative effects nor any apparent pain.\n- However, when Isshiki attempted to place another one while inhabiting Jigen, he and Amado utilised a seemingly different method that involved scientific aid, in which Isshiki would activate the seal from Jigen, and spread it to a recipient, causing them intense pain and, if incompatible, the recipient would most likely die, as thirteen children died this way.\n- It is also possible that a failure be instead be gifted the White Kāma, granting them the pure power of an Ōtsutsuki but not as a receptacle for the soul.\n- As Amado noted, the most important factor of applying Kāma is the selection of the vessel; if an Ōtsutsuki uses an inadequate vessel for a revival, the body will be unable to handle the enormous chakra, and most likely die within a couple of days.\n- Compatibility seems to be rare, as out of the fifteen children Isshiki attempted, Kawaki is the sole success, and Isshiki himself noted how Boruto's affinity with Momoshiki's Kāma to be uncommon.\n- Placing a Kāma onto a clone is ineffective, as the mark will vanish and will not transfer back to the original.\n- Once the Kāma is applied, its process of spreading the biological data into the vessel and the final resurrection initiates automatically, in which not even the caster can control it.\n- When an Ōtsutsuki resurrects, this also causes all Kāma currently existing on other vessels to disappear.\n- This leaves the Ōtsutsuki vulnerable to a permanent death as there is no other vessels to anchor their soul in the living realm and ultimately extinguished, unless they can apply another Kāma, especially if forced by circumstance to resurrect in an imperfect vessel.\n- He originally hoped to use it to weaken Isshiki, and theorises that this drug can stall Momoshiki from reincarnating through Boruto, as the Byakugan originates from the Ōtsutsuki, and weakening the kekkei genkai may slow the Kāma that is transforming Boruto's cells.\n- An individual who has been given Kāma is viable to serve as a sacrifice for Ten-Tails, as they technically become Ōtsutsuki.\n- Similarly, even if the data has been fully extracted but the vessel has yet to be reborn as Ōtsutsuki, if said vessel is incompatible with the Kāma to begin with, this will also result in the God Tree's reduced size and ability to produce a fruit.\n- Using Kāma in battle could prove taxing for less skilled users, even more so when they are already weakened, as Kawaki quickly collapsed after using it against Garō as he was already injured from defeating Kara's robots while Boruto was left so badly weakened after using it for the first time that he collapsed and had to be helped to return to Konoha.\n- Additionally, activating it seems to cause a not sufficiently experienced user some pain, as Boruto expressed pain whenever he activates Kāma.\n- Jigen doesn't seem to suffer these weaknesses as he is much more capable at using them than either Boruto or Kawaki, as he never showed any reaction when activating Kāma and using it in his prolonged battle with Naruto and Sasuke had no effect on him.\n- However, one known weakness of the seal that even Jigen seems to suffer from is that incomplete vessels could breakdown from channelling Kāma's full power, as after overpowering Naruto and Sasuke, the blackened section of his body cracked and he even cried soon afterwards and was forced to retreat back to be treated by Amado.\n- Kāma can only absorb energy-based substances, like chakra, hence the wielder is vulnerable to physical matter based attacks or abilities such as viruses and natural flames.\n- Furthermore, if a chakra-based construct is composited with enough physical matter, Kāma cannot absorb it.\n- * \"Kāma\" means \"wish\", \"desire\", or \"longing\" in Hindu literature, and in Japanese it is also an uncommon way to write \"karma\".\n- * Sarada Uchiha has theorised, due to their similar appearance, that the Strength of a Hundred Seal may be related to it.\n- * Amado compared the Kāma's function to a sugar cube placed into a cup of coffee: both would slowly spread throughout their vessels, and upon completion, both would dissolve and disappear.\n- * Any Ōtsutsuki who intends to become a sacrifice for the Ten-Tails to bloom into a God Tree utilises Kāma to prepare a vessel beforehand, for their revival later on.\n- ** At 80% of data extraction in a vessel from a Kāma, Momoshiki believes this is sufficient to make the target a sacrifice for the Ten-Tails.\n- * In the anime, Isshiki had also attempted to apply the Kāma on adults.\n- However, Garō did not gain a White Kāma.\n- * When Momoshiki used the Shadow Clone Technique through his vessel, his Kāma applied to his clone, but when Boruto used the technique Kāma didn't apply to his clones.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Momoshiki was also able to force aside Boruto's consciousness while he was debilitated by Amado's Byakugan-suppressing medication, allowing him to temporarily manifest without the drawback of limited chakra.\n- According to Garō, a chance of survival comes at a cost, as he himself was chosen and survived, but at the cost of his right arm.\n\n## Notes\n- Compatibility with an Ōtsutsuki is exceedingly rare and unpredictable, and if an individual is not a suitable recipient, the ritual will typically result in them suffering a fatal seizure.\n- Such individuals are unable to serve as a receptacle for the Ōtsutsuki's soul and thus cannot be used for the process of reincarnation, nor can use its absorption power nor space-time ninjutsu, but retain its other traits, gaining tremendous power and even being able to transform into a completely new Ōtsutsuki.\n- Until then, they are not considered true Celestial Beings, as they are not immune from the effects of Omnipotence.\n- Upon activation the visible marking will spread across the vessel's body, at times taking on different patterns depending on the abilities being used.\n- Typically black, these markings may also shimmer and glow with a particular colour when activated (red in Kawaki's case and blue in Boruto's case), and when viewed up close appear to spread in blue patterns resembling microscopic circuitry.\n- When activated, it spreads across his face and body in nearly symmetrical sunburst patterns.\n- Progressing further, he sprouts a long horn identical to Isshiki's.\n- When activated, it spreads across the left side of his body, forming a pattern that almost perfectly mirrors Boruto's, extending up to his left eye, and then glows red.\n- Progressing further, he sprouts a short horn resembling Isshiki's.\n- Code : Among Isshiki's previous failed candidates was Code, the only failed vessel of the children Jigen gathered that survived the ritual.\n- When activated, it spreads grey (light blue in the anime) markings along the left side of its body forming a pattern that almost mirrors Jigen's, extending to the left eye.\n- When activated, it spreads across the right side of his body, forming angular and curving geometric patterns, extending up to his right eye, and then glows blue.\n- Progressing further, he sprouts a horn similar to Momoshiki's and his right eye turns into a Byakugan.\n- Following Boruto's attempted suicide, Momoshiki used the remaining 18% to revive Boruto to save his soul, cancelling his resurrection through Boruto.\n- This ability seems to be rather advanced as only Jigen was able to use it by himself, Boruto and Kawaki's needing to cooperate to use it instead at first.\n- When accessing this power, ring markings seem to appear around the user's fingers.\n- In this state the user will begin to undergo a physical transformation, growing horns and awakening their Dōjutsu, generally limited to a single eye.\n- According to Kawaki, knowing that he and Isshiki were alike helped him realise that he could do anything Isshiki was capable of, allowing him to quickly intuit how his abilities worked.\n- Boruto was initially unable to enter this state without Momoshiki taking over his consciousness, but was able to partially access it while affected by Amado's Byakugan-suppressing medication.\n- This seems to only be possible after a great deal of time, and typically only occurs when the vessel's chakra has been depleted to the point that they lose consciousness.\n- Despite being reformed virtually identical to how they were in their previous body, the Ōtsutsuki also retains all the memories, skills and knowledge from the vessel.\n- Amado speculates this is a safety feature to prevent duplicate incarnations of the same Ōtsutsuki.\n- If proven true this, could potentially allow Boruto to survive Momoshiki's reincarnation by subsequently reincarnating through a vessel of his own.\n- However, Amado believes it remains possible for the Ōtsutsuki to emerge from time-to-time.\n- Amado created a drug that weakens the Byakugan.\n- Untested possibilities led Amado believe the drug may require constant intake, that deteriorating eyesight and even death may result, and he warned that Naruto must not allow Hinata nor Himawari take it.\n- It remains dependent on how much of the data is extracted onto the body, as Momoshiki determined that Kawaki was viable due to having 80% of the process completed.\n- However, using such a vessel as a sacrifice will result in the tailed beast blooming into a God Tree of inferior size and a lower quality chakra fruit, as they are not completely Ōtsutsuki.\n- The latter is used as its official translation in Western media.\n- * In the anime, the first time Momoshiki took over Boruto, he spoke in a mix of his and Boruto's voice.\n- * After Boruto broke his horn in his second possession by Momoshiki, it became smaller than before in the third.\n"

      "markdown": "# Kamui\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Mangekyō Sharingan, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu, Barrier Ninjutsu\n- Class: Offensive, Defensive\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Black Zetsu, Kakashi Hatake, Madara Uchiha, Obito Uchiha\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie\n\n## Summary\nKamui is a space–time ninjutsu that can be used with Obito Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan. These transfers are often characterised by a spiralling void that targets swirl into or out of, distorting their form as they move between dimensions.\n\n## Usage\n- The user looks at a target and creates a \"barrier space\" around them, with the barrier's size being determined by the user.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Targets that enter Kamui's dimension are completely untraceable, as not even their chakra can be detected while they're there.\n- Targets that exit Kamui's dimension do so with varying force, either simply appearing at the ejection point or flying from it; if weapons, such as shuriken, are stored in Kamui's dimension, ejecting them forcefully gives Kamui's users an offensive application.\n- Using Kamui is the only known way to travel to and from its dimension.\n- This means that targets transferred there are trapped, forced to stay until Kamui's user lets them leave; Obito sometimes uses genjutsu on those he imprisons to keep them subdued.\n- But because Obito's two Mangekyō Sharingan spend years with different users – Obito himself and Kakashi Hatake – this makes Obito and Kakashi essentially immune to each other's Kamui: although one of them can use Kamui on the other, the other can just use Kamui on themselves to escape.\n- This also means they can block or counter each other's attempts to use Kamui on others.\n- Obito, while in the Purgatory, was able to use Kamui to temporarily return his soul to Earth to continue assisting Kakashi by granting him the use of his Sharingan for a short time.\n- Obito most often uses this version on himself, sucking himself into his right eye to enter Kamui's dimension and then exiting back to whatever location he pleases.\n- Obito can perform this teleportation at will and doesn't need to designate his destination beforehand, Others can be sucked into Kamui's dimension through his eye in addition to or instead of Obito, and in fact it is faster for him to use Kamui on others than on himself.\n- Obito is usually shown making physical contact with those he's using Kamui on, but this isn't always consistent.\n- The other application of Obito's right Mangekyō, when activated, allows him to turn his body \"intangible\", automatically transferring body parts that otherwise would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into Kamui dimension.\n- Alternatively, Obito uses this ability to pass through barriers or other obstacles\n\nObito also had an unspecified way of cancelling Kakashi's usage of the left eye's Kamui when he attempted to decapitate the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, even though he wasn't touching or relatively near the statue.\n- When the user concentrates, anything within the barrier is pulled towards its centre, transferring the target to Kamui's dimension.\n- Similarly, because Kamui is used with a Mangekyō Sharingan, repeated use damages Kakashi's vision, eventually reaching the point where it causes his eyes to bleed.\n- When Kakashi receives chakra from the Nine-Tails, he is able to use Kamui faster, more often, and on targets as large as the Eight-Tails; he estimates that the Nine-Tails' chakra makes Kamui three times more powerful than usual.\n- Madara Uchiha takes Obito's Mangekyō from Kakashi so that he can gain access to Kamui's dimension.\n- Unlike with Obito, being the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki does not prevent Madara from using Kamui.\n- While Kamui ordinarily only connects its dimension with the Earth, the user can synchronise Kamui with other space–time ninjutsu, allowing the user to travel to the other ninjutsu's target dimension.\n- The two powers of Kamui can be used separately, even if to achieve a unified purpose: Obito once used the left Kamui to synchronise with Yomotsu Hirasaka, then used the right Kamui to teleport to its associated dimension.\n- With the two Mangekyō, users can also perform Susanoo, through which they can create Kamui Shuriken.\n- In a more general Japanese context, Kamui refers to the might and majesty of the gods, particularly the Shintō kami.\n- * Unlike other Mangekyō Sharingan users, Obito's continuous and general usage of Kamui does not seem to deteriorate his eyesight, and likewise does not tire or strain his body.\n- * Occasionally, Obito is depicted using Kamui without activating his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n- * In the anime, the Hizashi Hyūga of Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero uses a technique similar to Kamui.\n- * The space-time ninjutsu of Shin Uchiha, Nue, Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki and Sarada Uchiha are similar in function to Kamui.\n- * In Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker , there are 2 versions of Obito's close-range Kamui: for Obito, and for Kakashi Hatake (Double Sharingan).\n\n## Drawbacks\n- during early appearances, while using the \"Tobi\" persona, Obito commonly pretended to be hurt or feel pain to confuse opponents.\n\n## Notes\n- Sometimes he does this in order to escape attacks, other times he does this in order to travel long distances.\n- Everything he's touching, including his clothes, weapons and even other people will become intangible too.\n- In time, he becomes accurate enough to teleport projectiles mid-flight, and later can make the barrier space large enough to teleport the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path's head.\n- originally his limit is three times in a day, but this is later increased to an unspecified number.\n- The power of both eyes also grants the user the ability to generate large portals that can allow others to travel through.\n- Opening portals to those other dimensions requires a great deal of chakra, so much that users will likely need another person's assistance.\n- This possibly stemmed from Obito's access to Hashirama Senju's cells augmenting his body, similar to them reducing Kotoamatsukami's recharge time from 10 years to one day, or extending how long a Sharingan user can keep Izanagi active.\n- * Although teleporting objects from a distance is the left eye's ability, Obito uses the right eye to teleport Kaguya's All-Killing Ash Bones.\n- ** This was likely done to prevent tension from building regarding Tobi's identity until just before his identity was revealed rather than being an actual ability of Obito's.\n"

as an older man who guides them through the experiments she had conceived and as a kunoichi named Yatsume that is also one of the subjects to further study the others.\n- Those who die within the genjutsu do not die in the real world, but they remain stasis in tanks until the genjutsu ends.\n- There are two ways of ending the genjutsu: the captives must kill Ōga within it or the Illusion scroll that is keeping the genjutsu active must be removed.\n- Should the former be chosen, Ōga would become comatose in the real world.\n- The following various genjutsu experiments test the subjects ability to survive.\n- ;Nine Lives\n\nBefore the first experiment, Ōga provided a test for any one of the subjects to participate.\n- She had ten cards, nine are \"death\" while one was \"life\", and if the participant picks the \"life\" card, they live.\n- A Kirigakure shinobi participated in this test, randomly picking a \"death\" card which resulted in him being killed by Ōga.\n- ;Collapse\n\nFor the first experiment, Ōga placed the now twenty subjects on a crumbling platform in the middle of an abyss.\n- The subjects are to reach a higher platform in order to survive.\n- With the help of Kiseru, those who were not shinobi were able to reach it with ladders placed on the top.\n- {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n!\n- Subjects !!\n- Outcome\n|-\n| Anaguma || Dropped to his death by Rokuro\n|-\n| Batta || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Boruto Uzumaki || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Fugō || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Kakesu || Dropped to her death\n|-\n| Kiseru Gankubi || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Namua || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Rokuro || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Shamo || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Unnamed Kusagakure shinobi || Proceeded;

Mei changes chakra inside her body into a powerful acidic fluid that will melt anything and spits out the viscous fluid from her mouth.\n\n## Usage\n- By distributing the liquid across a vast range, she creates an acid wall.\n\n## Notes\n- Both the shape and the amount are determined by her.\n- By spitting it out at short-range the technique's speed increases.\n- Anything that touches it will crumble and lose its shape.\n- Should her initial attack miss, a great deal of smoke is created by the effects of the acid, so a follow-up attack can be conducted while the enemy's vision remains obscured.\n- It can even melt chakra-based defences such as the Susanoo.\n- * In games, movies and initially in the anime, this technique was depicted to look like lava.\n"

The properties of this substance mean that it can both absorb and dissipate the force behind a blow when struck, resulting in it either deforming or bouncing upon impact.\n\n## Usage\n- As projectiles, he can control them remotely and they continuously gain momentum when bouncing off surfaces.\n\n## Notes\n- A skilled user of this technique, such as Dodai, is capable of making it appear as if they were intending to protect an object or individual within the sphere, when in fact they merely use the ball as a distraction in order to occupy an enemy, while instead covertly withdrawing the item in question from the ball during its formation.\n- Karyū's rubber balls, dubbed , are darker in colour and far more solid.\n- Used offensively for ranged attacks, Karyū's spheres can vary in size, from being hand held to rivalling the size of a house.\n- The damage each sphere can deal is proportionate to the amount of chakra put into the orbs.\n- In the first case, he places a small ball in front of him and then kicks it forcefully towards the opponent, causing the ball to act as a projectile and hit the opponent multiple times, ricocheting off walls.\n- In the second case, he enters a much larger ball and jumps inside it, crushing the opponent from above with the weight of the ball.\n- ** In his victory pose, Dodai is also able to spin small balls around his palm, just as Karyū did.\n"

He just manifested Orochimaru's true form -->\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Game\n\n## Summary\nThe Living Corpse Reincarnation is a technique that was developed by Orochimaru that allows him to transfer his soul to someone else's body. It is also referred to as the \"Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique\".\n\n## Usage\n- By repeating this process periodically, this effectively allows the user to remain in the realm of living, so long as they can keep the host body alive while residing within.\n- Orochimaru then swallows the new host and takes him or her to a separate, mental plane where he envelops the mind of his victim.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- # Unknown female — for replacing the hand Itachi Uchiha severed; left body to escape the effects of his arms being sealed away.\n- # Sasuke Uchiha — after having been absorbed by Sasuke when he reversed his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique, took over due to Itachi's battle with his brother lowering Sasuke's chakra enough for Orochimaru to gain control; was sealed away by Itachi.\n- # White Zetsu Clone — for the cells of Hashirama Senju, as well as to escape the fatal injury of releasing the Dead Demon Consuming Seal.\n- (anime only)\n* Sasuke Uchiha — for the Sharingan; postponed due to being overpowered by Sasuke, then sealed away before another of his consciousnesses was released by the Evil Releasing Method.\n\n## Notes\n- It was developed in order to fuel his dream of acquiring all the knowledge in existence, a feat that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime.\n- Orochimaru can only perform this technique once every three years.\n- It also seems that when the three years are almost over, he is forced to move into another host, as the previous one begins to weaken and reject him.\n- Presumably, if he had a proper container, he could stay in the host for a full lifetime.\n- The fact that he wanted to prepare Sasuke Uchiha and Kimimaro for the transfer before performing it reinforces this.\n- To perform this technique, Orochimaru reveals his true form: a gigantic white snake composed of smaller white snakes, by abandoning his current host's body.\n- The snake body then dies and falls apart, and Orochimaru's soul dominates the body (though the Sharingan seems to be able to reverse the process against Orochimaru, which also grants the host Orochimaru's supply of chakra and powers).\n- The souls of the hosts are kept alive within Orochimaru, leaving them \"still alive\", in a sense (albeit suppressed), and when Orochimaru switches hosts, the souls leave with him.\n- Apparently if the host of these souls' chakra level falls enough it is possible for them to resurface in material form as seen with Orochimaru surfacing with his Eight Branches Technique after Sasuke used up most of his chakra.\n- After taking over another body, Orochimaru modifies it to suit his theme of snakes, in order to increase his survival capabilities, such as stretching and bending his body, reconnecting any severed parts, and shedding his skin to heal injuries.\n- This ensures that if Orochimaru cannot transfer to another body within the three years' time, he can allow his current one to greatly heal and evade attacks, rendering it virtually immortal; Sasuke refers this as the .\n- Orochimaru also alters the face of his host to look like his original form.\n- After being revived through the Evil Releasing Method, Orochimaru seemingly circumvented this process, emerging in a slightly different snake form and then slithering into a White Zetsu clone's mouth.\n- # Unknown person — when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, another one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\n- # Gen'yūmaru — a desperate temporary replacement body before Sasuke Uchiha; left body for Sasuke Uchiha.\n- * Kimimaro — for the Shikotsumyaku; rejected due to terminal disease.\n- * Guren — for the Crystal Release; rejected due to being too late and loss of interest.\n"

Jiga claims to be able to do this because of the great amount of iron he ingests.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The potential risk of his technique is exploited when Hinata Hyūga introduces an interfering electric current into his chakra, causing he himself to become a powerful magnet.\n\n## Notes\n- He can activate or deactivate his own body's magnetism, ensuring that he is not affected by his technique.\n- In this state, he attracts a large quantity of iron sand to himself, and is forced into a vortex of sand and killed.\n"

However, the magnetic force weakens from object to object.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Any individual that comes into direct contact with these shuriken themselves are magnetised; as such, it is crucial that the opponent avoids all of them as even a single deflection will result in the production of a powerful magnetic field around their body.\n\n## Notes\n- Once a person has been magnetised, the user can manipulate the magnetic field in such a manner as to make any subsequent attack using a metallic weapon impossible to evade.\n- Toroi uses his Magnet Release to magnetise a large quantity of shuriken, which he then throws in the direction of his opponents.\n"

The amount of dust produced by this ability is comparable to that of the sand used during Gaara's Quicksand Waterfall Flow technique, but as gold is the heavier of the two, the former was capable of nullifying the latter when they clashed.\n"

Unlike the Mind Body Switch Technique, the user's consciousness remains within their own body while they use this technique, meaning that it can safely be used even when the user is outnumbered.\n\n## Usage\n- Because only their bodies are being controlled, targets remain aware of what their body is doing, though they won't understand why.\n- Users can control targets even from a distance, allowing the user to sow confusion among the target and their allies.\n\n## Notes\n- It is when outnumbered that this technique is most useful, as the user's opponents can be made to kill each other.\n- this technique can freely manipulate multiple bodies simultaneously.\n- *When this technique was used in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and the later games, Inoichi suddenly appears in front of Ino in order to tell the victim he'll be his opponent.\n- He then uses this technique, immobilizing the opponent with the intent to let her daughter attack the victim.\n- She then runs to his opponent and punches them into the sky.\n- Both high-five afterwards.\n"

Their consciousness moves slowly towards the target and travels in a straight line.\n\n## Usage\n- When their consciousness does successfully make it to the target, the user supplants the target's mind and takes total control of their body.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- This isn't necessarily an issue in one-on-one encounters, but when facing multiple opponents this leaves their body vulnerable to attack.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Ino uses a different hand seal to perform this technique.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- To prevent this from happening, the Mind Body Switch should only be used against targets that are stationary or that are restrained.\n\n## Notes\n- If the user misses their target, it will take several minutes for their consciousness to find its way back to their own body.\n- The Mind Body Switch is ideal for intelligence-gathering, and in fact that's why it was originally created; Users can take advantage of the target's physical abilities, such as a bird's flight to better recon an area.\n- Users can also perform their own jutsu while possessing another, notably their sensory skills.\n- While possessing another's body, users can communicate with their targets.\n- Ordinarily, the Mind Body Switch lasts until the user chooses to release it.\n- Targets with strong wills can force users from their body, something that becomes easier to do if the user is low on chakra.\n- While a user is possessing a target, their own body is left inert.\n- Furthermore, any damage the possessed body receives is done to their original body as well.\n- It is for this reason that Yamanaka are so often teamed with members of the Akimichi and Nara clans; the Akimichi keeps opponents at a distance, and Nara can use their shadow to manipulate the Yamanaka's body.\n- * Rin no Sho lists the Mind Body Switch Technique as having a range of up to ten metres.\n- * In the anime, Ino was unable to use this technique on Sora when he was in a version 1 form, as Sora's consciousness was swallowed by the beast's demonic chakra.\n- The manga later shows her using it successfully against a version 2 Kinkaku, who maintained his consciousness.\n- * In Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles , Ino uses a variation of the technique called , which switches the minds of two separate targets, instead of her own.\n"

With focus the user can communicate with multiple people at once and the targets can also communicate with one another while the technique is in effect.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The more people that are connected through this technique however, the more a physical strain is put on the user, forcing them to keep the connection going for shorter periods to otherwise avoid sustaining injuries.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Depending on the skill of the user, one may require the aid of a device to make use of this technique for connections to multiple people as Inoichi's usage to connect with the entire Allied Shinobi Forces for more than ten seconds caused him to suffer a nosebleed.\n\n## Notes\n- This technique is not limited to just transmitting thoughts.\n- Images, such as memories, or even strong feelings can be conveyed.\n"

When the opponent counters and inflicts damage upon the puppet or the puppet inflicts damage on the enemy, the cursed seal will take effect, causing the kanji to disappear from the puppet's forehead and the two consciousness (that of the user's inside the puppet and that of the victim who countered) to switch.\n\n## Usage\n- Consequently, the user will gain full control of the opponent's body, while the victim's mind remains trapped within the immobile puppet.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Unlike the original, the user does not have to worry about the target's will overpowering their own, as it is sealed in the puppet.\n\n## Notes\n- Like the original technique, the user's body is left defenceless while the ability is active and any injury done to the victim's body is also reflected upon their true body, but this can be rectified if the user cancels the technique just before any damage is received.\n"

It is a cooperation ninjutsu where three users, after throwing shuriken at their target and forming the necessary hand seals, can create corporeal replicas of the shuriken — turning a small amount of shuriken to a large amount in an instant with which to bombard the enemy.\n\n## Notes\n- Unlike the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique, however, this technique makes no use of the Shadow Clone Technique.\n"

Creating even a single shadow clone will require half of a user's chakra, for which reason the normal Shadow Clone Technique is generally only safe to use for jōnin.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- For this reason, the First Hokage declared it forbidden and hid it away in the Scroll of Seals.\n- * In Kakashi Hiden , while waiting for his new arm, Naruto creates shadow clones with a one-handed seal: a cross with his left hand's index and middle finger.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Because of how many clones are created with the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the chakra cost is far greater, rendering it unsafe to use for most people other than the Hokage.\n\n## Notes\n- Naruto Uzumaki is among the few exceptions to this rule because of the sheer amount of chakra he has access to.\n- Naruto also utilises the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while creating the Wind Release: Rasengan, completing years' worth of training within a matter of days.\n- Despite this, he performs a Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, creating dozens of copies of himself and scaring the thugs away.\n- * In the anime, when Hōki claims to be using the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, he is actually using the Haze Clone Technique.\n- * In the anime, Boruto Uzumaki pretends to use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique by having his classmates transform into him.\n- ** He later uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique through the Shinobi Gauntlet, and then by himself against Deepa.\n"

By using their own body as a medium for the paper, the reincarnated individual creates several exploding tags formed from large sheets that each bear five seals on them.\n\n## Notes\n- These special tags then attach themselves to the intended target, but just as they detonate, additional tags are created as these previous ones explode.\n- This process is continuously repeated, leading to a near infinite chain reaction of consecutive explosions.\n- By sacrificing themselves, this technique can also be employed by a live individual.\n- ** As 五情, it refers to the five passions (anger, joy, hatred, desire, and grief).\n- ** As 互譲, it means \"conciliation\" or \"compromise\".\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Tobirama uses this technique in conjunction with the Water Release, trapping the opponent in the massive Water Prison Technique and then destroying it with the explosion of the explosive tags.\n"

This chakra is easily manipulated into various shapes to create techniques, making it one of the most versatile jutsu around.\n\n## Usage\n- MPM Destroy.png| : The chakra feathers are used to attack.\n- MPM Apparition.PNG|If the user is close to death, they can use their remaining chakra to draw a symbol in the ground which allows them to temporarily resurrect themselves as a ghost-like apparition to even the score with whoever killed them.\n- However, this may not be a true technique, as Akahoshi was under control of the meteorite and did not form the dragon himself.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- This apparition can seemingly deflect attacks, use any moves it could in life and be cloned through another's use of the Shadow Clone Technique.\n\n## Notes\n- These techniques are honed through Star Training, which requires the ninja to spend large amounts of time focusing on their chakra and meditating in the presence of the meteorite.\n- Even for those who master the technique, there is still a high chance that their body will slowly weaken and eventually perish.\n- At least three people (including Sumaru's father, Hotarubi, who dies from extensive exposure), show severe physical trauma.\n- Natsuhi is the only known person who endured the training with no side effecs.\n- This led the Third Hoshikage to ban the training.\n- With the meteor's destruction after Akahoshi's defeat, the training became lost forever.\n- The chakra that the beast is made of is dense enough to repel shuriken thrown at it.\n- MPM Join.png| : Combines two chakra beasts into one larger beast.\n- MPM Wings.png| : The chakra feathers form wings strong enough to support a normal sized human in short flight.\n- MPM Choke.png|The chakra feathers turn into ropes to ensnare and strangle a target.\n- MPM Dragon.png| : After implanting the star into himself, Akahoshi formed a dragon that could shoot blasts of star chakra at the opponent, and can also grow wings to increase its power.\n- MPM Rope.png| : The user extends their chakra into a binding rope that cannot be cut.\n- MPM Chakra Predation.png| : The user steals star chakra from another comrade and devours it, making their own stronger.\n"

Pain channelled the power of the Naraka Path through the body of a priest.\n\n## Usage\n- If the person was lying or refused to answer the questions, the King of Hell would remove their tongue and consume it, apparently killing them.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * In Buddhism, the Naraka realm, or \"hell realm\", is a plane of rebirth, based on Karma (actions of body, speech, and mind) built up in a previous life or lives.\n- There are various Naraka, each containing beings that are tormented until their Karma has achieved its full and satisfactory results.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- However, if they told the truth, they would be spared, although left extremely exhausted.\n- With its restorative abilities, the Naraka Path can easily be regarded as the most valuable body if the Six Paths of Pain is being used through six different bodies.\n\n## Notes\n- The Naraka Path ability makes heavy use of the King of Hell.\n- The King of Hell is a large head which sprouts out of the ground surrounded by purple flames.\n- It also possesses the Rinnegan as well as the shared field of vision along with the other summons.\n- To interrogate, the Naraka Path need only catch hold of a person, causing the King of Hell to appear before them.\n- With the victim seemingly paralysed, the Naraka Path begins questioning them.\n- After answers are given, the King of Hell will unzip its mouth to release tendril-like arms and would draw out an apparition of the victim's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue.\n- The King of Hell would then proceed to pass its judgement.\n- The second ability the Naraka Path possessed is the ability to repair any damage.\n- To do so the Naraka Path has the King of Hell ingest the damaged body with its tendril-like arms into its mouth, then, after some time, the destroyed body will emerge from its mouth, completely rejuvenated.\n- It did this for example to the Asura Path after it was destroyed by Chōji and Chōza Akimichi.\n- During formation, Nagato puts the Naraka Path at the rear behind the sentimental Deva Path with the other four taking the front lines.\n- Kabuto Yakushi stated that a Naraka Path user can transport bodies and souls using the King of Hell.\n- In Hinduism it is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins.\n- Yama is the Lord of Justice and the King of Hell.\n- He assigns appropriate punishments to living beings after death.\n- For example, he might immerse them in boiling oil.\n- If you lie to him, he will rip out your tongue.\n- The beings can then be reborn into a higher plane.\n- * The Naraka are superficially similar to the Christian hell or purgatory, although there are many significant differences.\n"

Kurama has used this ability to find Naruto Uzumaki's inner hatred, which has brought it close to breaking the seal which contained it numerous times before Naruto took control of the fox's chakra himself.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * Despite Minato Namikaze having mastered full control of Yin-Kurama sealed inside of him, he didn't demonstrate access to this technique.\n\n## Notes\n- When Naruto achieved the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he in turn gained access to this ability, aptly displayed when he uncovered Kisame Hoshigaki hiding within Samehada — even though Kisame and the sword both shared the same chakra signature.\n- It's unclear if he used this ability, since he had not entered his Chakra Mode.\n- * Thanks to this technique, Naruto was key in weeding out the transformed White Zetsu Army clones that were wreaking havoc on the Allied Shinobi Forces during the first night of the Fourth Shinobi World War.\n- * In Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison , Satori possessed a similar ability, though it could only sense fear.\n"

      "markdown": "# Nine-Tails Chakra Mode\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Element/Type: <!--Do NOT add Yin or Yang Release!-->\n- Classification: Ninjutsu, Chakra Flow,\n- Class: Offensive, Defensive, Supplementary\n- Users: Kurama, Minato Namikaze, Naruto Uzumaki, Menma Namikaze~anime\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie\n\n## Summary\nThe Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is a unique form of transformation that is granted to the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails. The form's design differs between users and can even change over time, but certain features are consistent across all forms: two horns on their head, six magatama markings around their neck, some sort of prominent circular/swirl design over their stomach, and various other lines extending along their body.\n\n## Usage\n- Kurama is able to speak through this replica and can be granted control of it; His pupils become a combination of the two forms: the vertical fox-slits with the horizontal toad-slits.\n- This mode allows Naruto to have high speed, dodging Isshiki's high speed rods, something Sasuke has trouble with even with his Sharingan.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- While using just the basic Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto Uzumaki is strong enough to defeat members of the White Zetsu Army with a single kick and fast enough to dodge the Fourth Raikage using his Lightning Release: Body Flicker Technique.\n- Naruto is able to transfer his and Kurama's chakra to others, granting them tailless version 1-like chakra shrouds that greatly enhance their techniques: Hinata Hyūga, for example, is able to deflect one of the Ten-Tails' tails with a single Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm.\n- Kakashi Hatake states that the power and volume of the transferred chakra is even greater than when Kurama earlier directly handed chakra to him, which had improved his Kamui at least three-fold.\n- Naruto notes he can absorb natural energy more quickly than usual while in Kurama Mode.\n- When Naruto uses the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with Six Paths Sage Mode, his abilities are pushed even further, demonstrated by him becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard and durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Because Naruto \"shelves\" his own chakra in this form and instead draws on the Nine-Tails', his early uses of it come with a risk that the Nine-Tails will take that shelved chakra, resulting in Naruto's death.\n- Naruto must, therefore, be careful of how long he uses the form for and how many shadow clones he creates, as doing too many only increases the risk.\n\n## Notes\n- Like all jinchūriki transformations, the user's physical abilities are enhanced while the mode is active, with greater enhancements coming from using more of the Nine-Tails' chakra.\n- The chakra that surrounds the user also helps in protecting them from damage, allowing them to take lava and boil-based attacks and suffer only minor injuries.\n- Naruto is even able to survive Tenpenchii because of his protective cloak, though the cloak itself is lost in the process.\n- The user's scent and chakra signature also change.\n- From the chakra that surrounds them, users are able to produce chakra arms as a way to interact with their surroundings or improve their manoeuvrability.\n- Naruto primarily uses the arms to help him form the Rasengan and its variants, having the arms assist with the shape or nature transformation that he usually relies on shadow clones for.\n- Minato's nine-tails chakra mode.png|Minato's Yin Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.\n- While using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, users' eyes become orange but their pupils remain the same.\n- Like previous jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails, Naruto is able to sense negative emotions while he's in this form, seemingly regardless of distance or obstructions.\n- He also releases a powerful life force while the mode is active, causing wood constructs to quickly mature into full-grown trees when he's nearby\n\nDespite the passive abilities and enhancements he gains, Naruto's use of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is initially marked by limitations due to the Nine-Tails refusing to cooperate with him.\n- This prevents him from using Tailed Beast Balls while in this form, though he is eventually able to create miniature versions.\n- The Nine-Tails eventually stops trying to take Naruto's chakra, and soon after that, starts cooperating, removing these limitations.\n- Naruto Chakra Mode the Last.png|Naruto's complete Kurama Mode.\n- Once Naruto learns the Nine-Tails' name - Kurama - their hearts synchronise and Naruto becomes able to enter what is referred to as .\n- His pupils becomes slitted, the whisker-like markings on his face become thicker to resemble the ☰ trigram, and the chakra shroud's shape alters to resemble a full-length haori, similar to the one Minato usually wears.\n- and tails.\n- In The Last: Naruto the Movie , Naruto is shown isolating the Kurama Mode transformation to one hand.\n- Despite Kurama's contribution, C claims the transferred chakra more closely resembles Naruto's own.\n- Whereas other jinchūriki's Tailed Beast Modes cause them to fully transform into their respective tailed beast, Naruto and Minato's are instead an alteration of their earlier chakra cloaks changed to resemble Kurama: Naruto's is the same translucent golden colour as his earlier cloak, while Minato's is a much darker orange colour with both having similar black lines all across its body.\n- Minato is able to enter this form directly from Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, while Naruto must initially first enter Kurama Mode.\n- Naruto is initially limited to only using this form for five minutes because he hasn't perfected his bond with Kurama, and then again to some unspecified limit.\n- While Tailed Beast Mode is active, Naruto and Minato hover within the construct's head.\n- They can in fact allow others to enter the construct as well, extending its protection to them and allowing Kurama to heal their wounds and replenish their chakra.\n- Because it isn't a proper transformation, Naruto and Minato can still use their other jutsu from within this form, such as the Rasengan and Shadow Clone Technique, and can even use the construct's tails as chakra arms.\n- After meeting Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki during the Fourth Shinobi World War, these abilities are further augmented by the powers of the Six Paths Sage Mode and the Six Paths Senjutsu.\n- Gaiden NTCM and SPSM.png|Naruto's second mode in the Boruto anime.\n- Naruto's 1st NTCM and SPSM - Boruto Movie.png|Naruto's initial mode during Boruto: Naruto the Movie .\n- Naruto's 2nd NTCM and SPSM - Boruto Movie.png|Naruto's second mode during Boruto: Naruto the Movie .\n- Naruto's 1st NTCM and SPSM - Boruto Manga.png|Naruto's initial mode in the Boruto manga.\n- Naruto's 2nd NTCM and SPSM - Boruto Manga.png|Naruto's second mode in the Boruto manga.\n- After receiving Hagoromo's power, Naruto gains the ability to use the Six Paths Sage Mode, and the initial appearance of his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode while simultaneously using it changes: his body is coated in yellow chakra; a sort of circular design is featured prominently over his stomach; the whisker-like markings on his face become thicker to resemble the ☰ trigram; six magatama markings are present on or around his collar; various other dark designs appear along his body, sometimes densely enough to give the appearance that he's wearing a body suit beneath the yellow coat.\n- A pattern consisting of a Rinnegan-like marking above nine magatama also appears on his back.\n- His eyes become yellow and his skin does not glow along with the rest of his outfit when activated.\n- However, these same features are absent in later uses: the back pattern being gone, and his chakra mode once again consisting of orange eyes and yellow glowing skin like his chakra modes before he met Hagoromo.\n- The one consistent hallmark of Six Paths Sage Mode are Naruto's eyes: while his pupils maintain the cross of vertical fox-slits with horizontal toad-slats, there is no pigmentation around his eyes that would otherwise signify the standard Sage Mode.\n- This form is known as .\n- This mode allowed Naruto to use the Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken, which was able to match Sasuke's strongest attack and cause the Valley of the End and the surrounding area to be devastated.\n- However, because it consumes a lot of the users' chakra, Naruto cannot maintain this form for as long.\n- * Kurama's golden chakra and approximate age of a millennia evoke the , kitsune who gain golden fur upon growing their ninth tail and reaching 1,000 years of age.\n- They become equivalent to kami and ascend to the heavens.\n- * In the anime's Power arc, Naruto temporarily assumes an incomplete version of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode after breaking free from Kurama's influence.\n- During his brief time in the form, Naruto is able to form an incomplete Tailed Beast Rasengan, use chakra arms, and enter an imperfect version of the Tailed Beast Mode, although it lacked legs and possessed only six tails.\n- * When Minato first entered this mode, his bangs spiked upward and his chakra cloak gained horns similar to those of his son.\n- His hairstyle, however, reverted to its original state in the latter part of chapter 639.\n- * In the colourised versions of chapters 676 and 678 included in digital editions of Weekly Shōnen Jump , Naruto's skin in this mode was depicted as yellow and his eyes had orange irides, much like his previous transformations.\n- Later illustrations coloured by Masashi Kishimoto instead depict Naruto with his original skin colour and yellow irides.\n- The colouration was corrected in subsequent chapters and the Naruto: Colour Edition release of volume 71.\n- * Hagoromo attributes the presence of Kurama's chakra alongside Indra's and Asura's to his emergence from Madara's lower body as the Ten-Tail's jinchūriki after Kaguya's restoration.\n"

      "markdown": "# Omnipotence\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Shinjutsu\n- Class: Supplementary\n- Users: Ada, Shibai Ōtsutsuki~manga\n- Media: Anime, Manga\n\n## Summary\nOmnipotence is a shinjutsu claimed to be used only by a god, whose effect is to bring out the user's desires. It is described as a programming language that Gods have used to create worlds and to make anything real.\n\n## Usage\n- Akin to genjutsu, this power is capable of affecting the mind of others, but unlike other genjutsu, this jutsu can be used on a far greater scale.\n- Similar to the Infinite Tsukuyomi, this jutsu can be used on a worldwide scale, manipulating the memories of everyone on the planet to how the user sees fit.\n- However, because she is not an actual Ōtsutsuki, she has no conscious control of this technique, only able to instinctively use it to grant her deepest desires.\n- * The official Naruto website states that Omnipotence was used to create the current world.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Despite being affected, Sasuke seemed to be able to avoid the lingering effects of the changes by focusing on the initial contradictions right after the memory rewriting took effect.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- When Sarada and Sumire consulted Ada, she thought it was impossible to reverse the change, finding it more practical to rewrite new memories, which carried its own risks.\n\n## Notes\n- Because of this ability, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki declared this technique to be the most powerful shinjutsu.\n- Her first known use of this shinjutsu was charming everyone, both male and female, around her with her desire to find true love.\n- The only exceptions to the charm are family members and the Ōtsutsuki clan.\n- Later, desiring to please Kawaki, along with channeling Kawaki's desire for Boruto to be viewed as an outsider like him, Ada’s subconscious caused this power to rewrite the memories of everyone on a global scale, even those removed from the dimension Omnipotence was cast in, to perceive Kawaki as the son of the Seventh Hokage and Boruto as the outsider taken in by the Hokage, effectively making the two switch lives with each other.\n- Beyond the initial rewrite, over the next three years, Omnipotence also suppressed any lingering sense of contradiction in those affected, such as Kawaki's body being modified by Kara despite supposedly being born and raised in Konoha, as well as Momoshiki's absence, and those confronted about the changes become more stubborn in their refusal, even if they are confronted with visual evidence.\n- Even the concept of Omnipotence is removed from the minds it affects, so if someone is told that the memory rewrite took place, the knowledge about it will fade.\n- Ada similarly found it more likely that the affected majority would think the immune minority were the ones whose memories were tampered with if anyone tried reasoning with them.\n- Three years in, Mitsuki was taken aback by Kawaki's harsh treatment of him, and took notice of these feelings.\n- Similarly, Amado was able to recognise his own alterations in Kawaki's body, deducing his own memories must have been altered.\n- Hearing a report on Amado's theory, Shikamaru Nara began recognising that puzzling situations made more sense when memory alteration was considered.\n- If one is able to realise the truth that memories were altered without learning about Omnipotence, accepting as truth by themselves, is possible to retain some of that knowledge, something Boruto considers \"no mean feat\".\n- * The official Naruto website calls Ada's expression of Omnipotence .\n- * For reasons unknown, Sarada Uchiha and Sumire Kakei seem to be immune to Omnipotence cast by Ada.\n- * According to Momoshiki, those who are immune to the technique are the ones who will suffer the most from it.\n"

This technique can be used on both the living and dead.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Using it on the living can save and restore the target from an otherwise fatal condition but will leave the user greatly exhausted.\n\n## Notes\n- When used on the dead, the user will find certain death in exchange for the soul of the deceased.\n- While in use, the released chakra shines a pale-blue colour, and if the user's own chakra is insufficient, a third party can assist, but only the actual user of the jutsu will die.\n- As such, the only one who can use this technique is its developer, Chiyo, and as she is the sole known user, upon her death the technique is believed to be lost forever.\n- * The purpose of the technique was to give life to puppets, increasing their efficiency in battle.\n- Chiyo also wished to give the Mother and Father puppets the souls of Sasori's parents.\n- * In the anime, Ranmaru was capable of restoring an almost dead Raiga similar to how Chiyo restored a fatally injured Sakura Haruno.\n"

      "markdown": "# Orochimaru's Juinjutsu\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Juinjutsu, Kinjutsu, Senjutsu\n- Class: Supplementary\n- Range: Short\n- Users: Orochimaru\n- Media: Anime, Manga\n\n## Summary\nOrochimaru's Juinjutsu is a transformation-based cursed seal that Orochimaru can apply to others for various purposes. It also secretes special bodily fluids that react to contact with senjutsu chakra, causing immediate physical alternations with further controlled shape-shifting quality to the user's body, along with greatly enhanced physical capabilities.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- By isolating an enzyme from Jūgo's special fluids and mixing it with his own senjutsu chakra, Orochimaru created a cursed seal he could brand others with.\n- Orochimaru typically gives his cursed seals to either his more powerful followers or those he would like to use as his host body.\n- To apply a cursed seal, Orochimaru bites the recipient's neck, causing the seal to appear near the puncture wound.\n- Recipients are rendered unconscious while their body either accepts or rejects the cursed seal.\n- From extensive practice, Orochimaru established a 10% compatibility rate for the cursed seal; those whose bodies aren't compatible with the cursed seal will die.\n- If they do survive, the recipient will have access to the cursed seal's power boosts, access that grows through repeated use.\n- If unused, cursed seals will grow dormant, though Orochimaru can forcefully activate them if he gains access to them.\n- Cursed seals seen in the anime tend to have fatal consequences even if the recipients survive the initial application.\n- Mizuki's seal, which was a failed prototype that required extra procedures to activate, nearly kills him due to its incompleteness and causes him to lose all his powers.\n- The cursed seals administrated to Team Guren kill them if they do not take the required medication periodically, preventing them from escaping Orochimaru's clutches.\n- On the other hand, the seals given to the Iburi clan partially stabilised their otherwise unstable ability.\n- Once applied, removal of the cursed seal is apparently difficult.\n- Kakashi Hatake and the Third Hokage have on separate occasions opted to suppress the cursed seals rather than remove them outright.\n- The only times the cursed seal have been fully removed have been as a side-effect of removing Orochimaru's consciousness from the recipient's body, fragments of which are embedded in each of the cursed seals: Itachi Uchiha does so with the Sword of Totsuka; Sasuke Uchiha does so with the Evil Releasing Method.\n- So long as part of his consciousness remains in a cursed seal somewhere, Orochimaru can never truly die.\n- Until they become accustomed to it, use of the cursed seal will cause them intense physical pain, though they may be able to briefly ignore this.\n- While active, the cursed seal feeds off their chakra and replaces it with Orochimaru's own senjutsu chakra, So long as they have at least some chakra of their own, this gives them a back up reserve that they can call on, though if not employed carefully this may have fatal consequences.\n- In exchange, the cursed seal synchronises with their body, exponentially enhancing the abilities of their normal state.\n- Recipients initially only have access to the cursed seal's .\n- When active, the seal's design spreads across at least half of their body from its point of application, glowing and replicating as its coverage grows.\n- In order to increase the advantages of using the cursed seal, as well as to eliminate some of the risks and discomfort that come from using its first level, Orochimaru developed Mind Awakening Pills to advance cursed seals to their next stage.\n- The of the cursed seal causes the user's body to physically transform.\n- Skilled users of the cursed seal are able to isolate transformations to specific parts of the body.\n- Second level transformations are always the same for a single user, but it's not known if the same cursed seal causes the same transformations in different users.\n- * Cursed Seal of Heaven: Worn by Sasuke Uchiha and Anko Mitarashi.\n- * Cursed Seal of Earth: Worn by Kimimaro.\n- * Sound Four's Cursed Seals : Worn by Jirōbō, Kidōmaru, Tayuya, Sakon and Ukon.\n- * Prisoners' Cursed Seals : Worn by Ahiko, Guren, Takishi and Tsukushi.\n- * Animal Cursed Seal (anime only) : Worn by Mizuki.\n- * Team Guren's Cursed Seals (anime only) : Worn by Nurari, Kihō and Kigiri.\n- * Iburi Clan's Cursed Seals (anime only) : Worn by Gotta and Yukimi.\n- *Orochimaru can apply other cursed seals by biting an opponent's neck.\n- These other cursed seals temporarily bind the target upon application, spreading across their body to restrict their movements.\n- *Orochimaru placed a strong cursed seal on Mitsuki's heart that would cause him to self-destruct should anyone attempted to decipher his synthetic body's structure.\n- Kū claims it is an older-type of cursed seal that they can work around, though the scientist found it rather difficult.\n\n## Notes\n- The degree to which this occurs is up to the user, and the degree to which it spreads is proportionate to the overall effect it has.\n- Under normal circumstances, the pills kill those who take them, requiring that they be placed in a near-death state after taking the pill while their body acclimates for the heightened transformation.\n- Called a , it is similar in appearance to Jūgo's transformations: they gain yellow irises and black sclerae, altered skin colour, longer hair, and significantly greater power.\n"

These souls may be recalled from even the crossroad between life and the afterlife, and are then returned to their rejuvenated bodies.\n\n## Usage\n- This technique can also be used to transform the corpse vessel of an individual revived by Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation into a real body of living flesh and blood.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The revived individuals are seemingly revived with a fully restored chakra level, as Kakashi did not require hospitalization to recover after revival, and was able to carry Naruto after he nearly passes out after his fight with Pain.\n\n## Notes\n- The exact limitations of this technique are unknown, but on one occasion, it was able to resurrect a large number of individuals who had recently died.\n- While using this technique, the caster is severely weakened; for instance, Nagato's hair turned white as a result of overexerting his power.\n- Ultimately, once the technique is finished, the user invariably dies.\n- However, whereas the rest of the reincarnated Madara Uchiha's body was made real, his eyes instead crumbled into dust upon his resurrection.\n- This method does not require the King of Hell to appear.\n- * Hashirama Senju identified this technique as a .\n- * When Nagato was preparing to use this technique, Konan feared for the worst due to his low chakra levels, implying she believed he could have potentially survived with more chakra.\n- Madara would eventually be revived by Impure World Reincarnation instead, and expressed surprise and disappointment that his return didn't go as planned, as only a living person can become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki.\n- After this, Naruto temporarily stabilised Obito's life force using his Six Paths Yang Power like he did with Might Guy after he used the Eight Gates Released Formation, allowing him to bring back Sasuke and later battle against Kaguya Ōtsutsuki.\n- However, as the both noted, Obito would still die as a result from using this technique.\n"

This technique is mainly used to restrict the movement of the target by coating a target's body, and forcibly make them do its bidding by directly channelling its will through them.\n\n## Usage\n- By using this technique, Black Zetsu can perform various feats including controlling the target, and even stabilising their life force allowing them to live following a mortally-taxing event.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Once in contact with a target, they can also absorb the target's chakra and transfer it to others, One drawback of this technique, is that if the target has a strong enough will as in the case of Obito they can suppress Black Zetsu's influence, and take advantage of Black Zetsu being attached to them.\n\n## Notes\n- In possession of the target's body, Black Zetsu is also able to use target's techniques, as well as any other ability they may possess.\n"

Pain channelled the Preta Path through the corpse of a Kusagakure shinobi.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- This ability is primarily defensive in nature as it is capable of absorbing chakra from an individual through physical contact.\n- In addition to this, the Preta Path is able to absorb ninjutsu-based techniques that are pure chakra or chakra based, thereby nullifying their effect.\n- It doesn't absorb physical attacks, like Gaara's sand, but does drain the sand's chakra.\n- This is done by forming a barrier around the user's entire body, allowing them to absorb attacks from all directions.\n- Although the ability is able to absorb senjutsu chakra, the user is still vulnerable to the effects of turning into a stone statue from absorbing too much of it.\n- During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used the Preta Path to absorb Killer B's chakra while he was in his Version 2 form.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- In appearance, the Preta are deathly pale, emaciated figures, which contrasts with Pain's Preta Path's hefty stature.\n\n## Notes\n- He then apparently used the chakra to revitalise his body to its state before it was emaciated by the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.\n- It also restored his hair colour back from white to red, as well as the damage done to his legs.\n- However, presumably due to loss of muscle memory, he was not able to use the legs completely.\n- This ability can be nullified if an opponent uses specific techniques that can either suppress the user’s movements or their chakra.\n- The Preta are humanoid creatures which are perpetually hungry and thirsty, but are unable to satisfy themselves, living lives similar to those of hopeless addicts trying to appease their unyielding hunger.\n- In Hinduism Preta could also mean ghosts this also relates to the technique the Preta path uses.\n"

Monzaemon originally intended the Puppet Technique for purely entertainment purposes, but by collaborating with shinobi he adapted the skill for combat.\n\n## Usage\n- Performing the Puppet Technique involves emitting from a user's fingers to connect to a puppet, with the fingers' movements controlling the puppet's actions.\n- Controlling a puppet requires most of a puppeteer's attentions and maintaining the threads is a constant drain on their chakra.\n- The threads can also be used to wrap around opponents in order to restrict their movements.\n- The threads can be connected to opponents to impede their movements, such as by tripping them, or to take control of their body, using them as a puppet.\n- The Ōtsutsuki were able to control their puppets (or other people) remotely from seemingly any distance.\n- The novelization of The Last: Naruto the Movie explains that this was achieved by placing orbs of chakra within the puppets' bodies, allowing the Ōtsutsuki to control their puppets through thought alone.\n- Over time, these puppets became mostly autonomous, requiring no conscious effort to control and only needing the Tenseigan to power their movements.\n- In Gaara Hiden , after Kankurō studies reports of the Ōtsutsuki's puppets, he achieves a similar effect by using imperceptibly thin chakra threads; although this doesn't make his puppets autonomous, it does significantly increase the range he can control them from.\n- * In some Naruto video games, Kankurō demonstrates greater versatility in hand-to-hand combat than puppeteers are said to possesses, as he mixes his puppet control with haymakers and other forms of taijutsu.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- In the event that an opponent gets too close, some puppeteers have devised countermeasures: certain puppets created by Sasori, such as Sanshōuo and Hiruko, are intended to be controlled from the inside, acting as shields for their puppeteers; Chiyo replaced one of her arms with a Mechanical Light Shield Block, giving her a defensive option to use in emergencies; Kankurō is in the habit of disguising puppets as himself, causing opponents that attack him to instead fall into his puppets' clutches.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Centuries before Monzaemon created his version of the Puppet Technique, the Ōtsutsuki clan used a different version that had fewer of the above drawbacks.\n\n## Notes\n- In the years following the technique's creation, Suna's shinobi became pioneers in the art of puppetry, with its Puppet Brigade being given the specific mandate of finding new ways to use and exploit puppets for battle.\n- No matter how many threads are being used per puppet, the user's will plays a large role in a puppet's movements, thus creating an inevitable time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response.\n- It should also be noted that, while the Chakra Threads are difficult to notice, it is possible to cut them, effectively disabling the puppet in the process.\n- Because puppeteers rely on their puppets for almost all aspects of combat, keeping the puppets safe is of paramount importance.\n- At the simplest, this means not allowing the puppets to be destroyed or otherwise disabled.\n- More than that, it is also vital to keep how a puppet works secret from opponents.\n- If an opponent knows what weapons or traps a puppet is outfitted with, the puppeteer will lose the advantage of surprise that so often gives them the upperhand.\n- If an opponent knows how a puppet is designed – which, unlike weapons and traps, cannot be greatly altered by the puppeteer – they can focus their attacks on the puppet's structural weaknesses.\n- If a puppeteer does lose their puppet in battle (or if they merely opt not to use one), the chakra threads remain a versatile tool.\n- Puppeteers can attach chakra threads to faraway targets even without this subterfuge, giving them a quick way to bring objects to their side.\n- * - practised by Sasori and Kankurō.\n- * - practised by Kankurō and Shinki.\n- He achieved this by connecting his chakra threads to pipes that distributed chakra across Rōran, expanding the number of threads and distance he could cover.\n"

See the Amenomihashira article for his technique-->Boruto Uzumaki, Jiraiya, Kakashi Hatake, Koji Kashin, Konohamaru Sarutobi, Minato Namikaze, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki, Naruto Uzumaki, Hiruko (missing-nin)~movie, Breeze Dancer~Game\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie, Movie canon\n\n## Summary\nThe Rasengan is a jutsu that takes form as a spinning ball of chakra, invented by Minato Namikaze. Because his lover, Kushina Uzumaki, was a jinchūriki, she would inevitably be deployed to fight opponents who would use Tailed Beast Balls against her.\n\n## Usage\n- This is by far the most difficult of the three steps because of how refined the user's chakra control must be.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- No hand seals are involved, in theory making it easy to learn and use, an assessment that Sasuke Uchiha agrees with after comparing the two.\n- It can be useful to know in which direction one's chakra naturally spins, in order to avoid impeding oneself.\n\n## Notes\n- Minato therefore wanted to develop a technique that Kushina could use to match against those opponents, which also worked with her chakra volume as a jinchūriki.\n- Minato struggled with the original concepts for the technique, as they were either too weak or too unstable for use.\n- It was only from a conversation with Jiraiya that Minato thought of a way to make the technique usable.\n- Because of Jiraiya's inspiration, Minato wanted to call the technique , but both Jiraiya and Kushina felt it was too long and lame.\n- Kushina suggested \"Rasengan\" instead, which Minato agreed was a better name.\n- Minato would continue refining the Rasengan, ultimately taking three years of development time to perfect it.\n- The Rasengan is an application of shape transformation, where chakra emitted from the palm is rotated in multiple directions simultaneously to contain it within a sphere.\n- If users thrust the Rasengan into targets, they can be propelled away from the user until they eventually collide with some obstacle.\n- The Rasengan's various attributes have earned it recognition as the pinnacle of shape transformation.\n- The Rasengan is in principle a simple application of shape transformation, but manipulating the motion of chakra in so many directions at once makes it extremely difficult to learn in practice.\n- Additionally, as the technique is simply a mass of chakra, the technique is primarily suited for users with very high reserves of chakra.\n- For this reason, Jiraiya breaks up the process into three steps when he teaches it to Naruto Uzumaki.\n- who in turn later uses them when he teaches it to Boruto Uzumaki:\n# Rotation - the user learns to spin their chakra in multiple directions at the same time.\n- Users may be given a water balloon while they practice, to help them mark their progress by the churning water.\n- The step is completed when users are able to burst the water balloon with their chakra.\n- In theory this should be done with one hand, but Naruto initially uses chakra from both of his hands to increase the agitation, thus saving time.\n- and in fact they may end up injuring themselves in the process of destroying the ball.\n- # Containment - the user must combine the first two steps into a contained sphere.\n- To help in this regard, users may be given a balloon to help them visualise the intended shape; if the balloon is popped or otherwise moves, mastery is not yet achieved.\n- Konohamaru by the time he begins leading Team 7.\n- Once learned, the Rasengan appears largely identical from one user to the next.\n- The only potential difference is its size: when Boruto first learns to use the Rasengan, it's noted to be quite small.\n- With greater proficiency, the size of a user's Rasengan grows to be about the size of their hand.\n- He is eventually able to overcome this obstacle by using a second shadow clone to provide the nature transformation while he and another shadow clone form the Rasengan.\n- This ultimately leads to the creation of the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, which is most notable for its ability to be thrown.\n- Years later, Boruto unknowingly adds his own lightning-nature to his Rasengan, which causes it to turn invisible if thrown, potentially lowering an opponent's guard before it strikes them.\n- It is fundamentally the same as the normal version, but the addition of natural energy into the mix the users chakra makes it notably stronger.\n- For Naruto, it is while using Sage Mode that he is first able to throw the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken,\n\n## Tailed Beast Influence\n\nNaruto, as a jinchūriki, can use the Nine-Tails' chakra to assist in using the Rasengan.\n- While using a version 1 cloak in Part I, he makes a Rasengan without the aid of a shadow clone, using the cloak itself to contain it.\n- Due to the Nine-Tails' influence, this Rasengan is darker in colour and much stronger.\n- Different video games have called it , , , and .\n- After learning to use the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in Part II, Naruto uses chakra arms in place of a shadow clone to help him create the Rasengan.\n- it is unknown if he succeeded.\n- * In the anime, if used underwater, the rotation force of the Rasengan is capable of creating a whirlpool.\n- * The anime shows Naruto being able to throw the Rasengan, something that is later established to require special training.\n- * Katasuke uses this technique through his Shinobi Gauntlet.\n- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 , Jiraiya spews fire onto his Rasengan, creating the Fire Release: Great Flame Rasengan.\n- * Jump Super Stars is one of the few video games where Part I Naruto is able to access his non-clone-refined version of his Rasengan, dubbed as .\n- ** Likewise also in both the first 2 Uzumaki Chronicles games, Naruto can perform a version of the Rasengan without a clone enhancing it (holding down the input in the second game does involve the clone and turns it into a \"True Rasengan/Spiralling Sphere\" with merely an increased damage multiplier and hitbox duration).\n- *** The video game Battle Stadium D.O.N.\n- also curiously does not have a clone assist Naruto in the formation of the technique.\n- * The Rasengan's appearance resembles Kūatsuken, a technique from the Ninku series.\n"

He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll.\n\n## Usage\n- As even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the Puppet Technique.\n- Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- As with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special poison, which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.\n\n## Notes\n- From the scroll, more than a hundred puppets wearing red cloaks emerge.\n- Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response.\n- However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.\n- Sasori stated that he brought down an entire country (the Land of This in the anime) with this technique.\n- Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with Chiyo and Sakura Haruno, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets.\n- While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents.\n- In the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside Hiruko.\n"

      "markdown": "# Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Ninjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu\n- Users: Jiji\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel\n\n## Summary\nThis reincarnation ninjutsu is one of the many subjects documented at the centuries-old Astronomy Research Institute, an archive of knowledge for the Land of Redaku. A few years prior to the events of Sasuke Retsuden , Zansūru, an archaeologist, deciphered enough of the relevant research to learn how to use this technique.\n\n## Usage\n- How the user controls the reincarnated is never made clear, only that there are no talismans placed in the skulls as is done with the Impure World Reincarnation.\n- The user's control over those they reincarnate is great enough that it can't be overcome with standard genjutsu.\n- Sasuke is able to somewhat erode the control over one dinosaur, Menō, by speaking to him kindly, refusing to harm him, and by offering to return him to the afterlife, something that Menō wants.\n- This momentarily allows him to establish control over Menō with a genjutsu, which he then makes permanent by channelling his chakra into Menō's body to overwrite Jiji's control.\n- Having control of a reincarnated form grants certain advantages.\n- Information gathered by the reincarnated can be instantly passed along to their controller, such as to help the controller locate somebody they're searching for.\n- Conversely, the controller can pass some of their chakra to the reincarnated, enhancing their strength: Menō, a juvenile of his species, is able to overpower an adult of the same species because he has access to Sasuke's chakra.\n- Control of one or more reincarnated subjects can be granted to non-users - as Jiji does to Zansūru - but these non-users cannot give commands that are too complicated.\n- One dinosaur is even shown clinging to its reincarnated body, using the brief window of no longer being controlled to attack Jiji, vengeance for having brought it back to the living world.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- This detail draws empathy from Sasuke, prompting him to avoid injuring the dinosaurs when possible: he believes Amaterasu could be used to \"kill\" the dinosaurs, burning them with undying flames and rendering them incapacitated, but decides not to try it so as not to subject them to the prolonged pain that would cause.\n- To release this technique, the user performs the same hand seals that are used to initiate it in the first place, thus freeing the souls (even those under the control of another) from their reincarnated bodies.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Unlike the humans reincarnated with the Impure World Reincarnation, who don't seem fazed by injuries, the dinosaurs reincarnated with this technique still feel pain.\n- The reincarnated beings bleed and can be killed with a serious enough damage.\n\n## Notes\n- However, because he was not a ninja, he recruited Jiji to perform it on his behalf.\n- A few decades prior to this, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama Senju's Impure World Reincarnation.\n- Zansūru insists that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant.\n- Like the Impure World Reincarnation, this technique brings back souls of the dead using living sacrifices; Jiji exclusively reincarnates dinosaurs (more commonly called \"dragons\"), but also planned to reincarnate a human, Margo, until he found out that she wasn't actually dead.\n- Jiji summons a dinosaur's soul using its fossilised remains and places its soul in the body of the live sacrifice: a chicken, one of the closest extant relatives of dinosaurs.\n- Dust and ash encase the chicken's body, giving it the same size and appearance as the dinosaur had in life.\n- The dinosaur's reincarnated body retains all the physical skills it had when it was alive.\n- In the novel, it also has the added advantage of being immortal; it can be damaged, but its body will repair itself indefinitely regardless of severity.\n- Not all wounds heal at the same speed, with burns being observed to still linger after several days.\n- Yet because they can't die, they must suffer through any injuries that would ordinarily kill them until their body is healed.\n- However in the anime adaptation this jutsu lacks most of the immortality advantages.\n- Furthermore, new commands will immediately override previous commands regardless of potential consequences; Zansūru at one point commands a flying dinosaur to let him ride it, but later gives the same dinosaur a new command unrelated to being ridden, causing Zansūru to fall off and die upon impact with the ground.\n- If and when the non-user dies, any commands they gave are rescinded and the original user's most recent commands take effect again.\n- The souls do not immediately return to the afterlife, instead lingering in their bodies for a few moments; this brief delay gives Sasuke and Menō a chance to exchange farewells.\n- Once the souls do finally depart, their body disintegrates back into the dust and ash that they were made of.\n"

The enhanced regeneration granted by the cells is so rapid that even dozens of puncture wounds, on top of various injuries inflicted by the combined physical assault of all nine tailed beasts were completely healed in mere moments.\n\n## Notes\n- This ability does not appear to extend to severed limbs as Madara instead replaced his severed arm with that of a White Zetsu clone's.\n- as he regenerated the half of his torso blown away by Night Guy and regenerated even after Sasuke Uchiha fully bisected him at the waist.\n- * With the genetic tissue transplanted into Madara and the artificial limbs for Obito each comprised of Hashirama's DNA, they both not only gained Hashirama's healing abilities, but also they no longer required any food or water to survive.\n- However, it is unknown if these two traits are related or if Hashirama himself was also endowed with the latter.\n- * Though Jūgo was in possession of Hashirama's cells at one point, he automatically converted them into his own before having a chance to use this ability.\n- * Those who possess a fragment of the Stone of Gelel inside their bodies will gain regenerative powers comparable to this ability.\n- * In the anime, Mugino states to be able to use Wood Release a person must have the First Hokage's cells, which suggests that the Wood Release user Moegi Kazamatsuri has access to this ability.\n- * In the anime, rumors have spread that the Regeneration Ability also will restore one's youth and extend their longevity.\n- Konoha-nin however have denied such claims.\n"

But whereas the regular Summoning Technique functions identically from one use to the next, the Reverse Summoning Technique has had two distinct uses seen in the series:\n* With the standard Summoning Technique, a shinobi summons an animal that they've signed a contract with to their location.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Whereas summons performed by shinobi have some sort of time limit, after which the animal will automatically return to its home, summons performed by animals have no known time limit, as Naruto Uzumaki remains at Mount Myōboku for several days after he's been reverse summoned there, and is not forcibly teleported back to Mount Myōboku when he is reverse summoned to Konohagakure during Pain's Assault.\n\n## Notes\n- The Reverse Summoning Technique does the opposite, allowing an animal to summon a shinobi that has signed a contract with its species to its location.\n- Animals can return the shinobi to where they were summoned from when they choose, potentially overlapping with the Reverse Summoning Technique's second form of usage.\n- * After a shinobi has summoned an animal, they can use the Reverse Summoning Technique to transport the animal to another location.\n- The shinobi and/or their allies can accompany the animal when this is done, such as by riding in its mouth, giving the shinobi a method of quickly traveling long distances or escaping confinement.\n- The exact reason for using the scroll is unclear.\n"

After forming the necessary hand seals, the user expels a dragon-like entity from their mouth that carries an orb in its left front claw.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- This alone greatly hinders those in the vicinity but, due to the intensity of the resulting vibrations, paralysing pain is also induced.\n\n## Notes\n- As the dragon tightly coils itself around the orb, it releases both blinding light and deafening sound by making the air oscillate.\n- Thus, the technique both briefly inhibits the opponent's senses, as well as techniques that require their active concentration.\n- According to Kabuto, only he is capable of functioning normally whilst this technique is in effect, thanks to the properties of his Sage Mode and his adopted abilities.\n- Due to his snake characteristics, Kabuto can close the cornea of his eyes to completely block the harmful light, whilst instead relying upon the enhanced perception of his other senses to compensate for his obstructed vision.\n- He can also liquefy the insides of his body in order to negate the effects of the harsh sound vibrations.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , the dragon is depicted as white.\n"

      "markdown": "# Sage Mode\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Senjutsu\n- Class: Supplementary\n- Users: Fukasaku, Gamakichi, Hashirama Senju, Jiraiya, Jūgo, Kabuto Yakushi, Minato Namikaze, Mitsuki, Naruto Uzumaki, Shima, White Snake Sage, Koji Kashin, Gamamaru~anime\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie\n\n## Summary\nSage Mode is an empowered state that can be entered by blending natural energy with one's chakra, creating senjutsu chakra. Sage Mode allows users to tap into the natural force of the world, opening up new techniques to them and allowing them to power up existing ones with the new senjutsu chakra.\n\n## Usage\n- ** Those who have mastered the Sage Techniques of the Ryūchi Cave have shown the ability to use natural energy to breathe life into inorganic substances and control them.\n- The combination of both forms allows for a greater power than either Tailed Beast Mode or Sage Mode individually, which allowed Naruto to hold his own against the likes of Obito Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * When facing an opponent that can drain chakra, this can prove to be fatal to the opponent if they absorbed too much chakra and will be turned to stone if they haven't had training with Sage Mode in the past.\n- Furthermore, the user of Sage Mode can hold still to absorb more natural energy for the opponent to absorb and turn their own chakra absorption against them.\n- * Kabuto Yakushi assimilated the DNA of Jūgo to replicate his clan's ability to passively absorb natural energy, thus allowing him to continuously collect the energy even while moving, bypassing these particular weaknesses.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- * Despite granting the user the ability to sense chakra, Jiraiya, Shima, and Fukasaku seemingly didn't display this ability during their fight against the Six Paths of Pain.\n- * In Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison , the red coat Naruto wore during Pain's Assault appears when he enters Sage Mode and disappears when he turns back to normal.\n\n## Notes\n- Users of Sage Mode must possess \"extreme chakra levels\" to invoke senjutsu.\n- It is also important that their bodies be strong enough to support the increased power.\n- Orochimaru, who discovered the Ryūchi Cave and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, was not able to use Sage Transformation to enter Sage Mode for this reason.\n- In order to enter Sage Mode, the gatherer must remain absolutely still in order to be one with nature and balance the natural energy with their own physical and spiritual energies.\n- If the user puts too little natural energy into using senjutsu, the technique will not work.\n- Conversely, if too much natural energy is taken in, their body will turn to stone forever; humans will also be transformed into whichever animal's school the senjutsu was learned from.\n- The toads of Mount Myōboku have devised several tools to make learning Sage Mode easier.\n- By applying a special oil, the applicant's body will start passively taking in natural energy.\n- This oil will evaporate if taken outside Mount Myōboku, thus rendering it useful only for learning purposes.\n- The toads also have a special staff that, when struck with, knocks all the natural energy out of the gatherer, thus reversing any transformations before they can become permanent and the user turns to stone.\n- At Ryūchi Cave, one must be bitten by the White Snake Sage, who injects them with natural energy.\n- According to legend, if one's body is strong enough to withstand said injection, it will accept the power without reservation.\n- If not, the snake will devour the person whole.\n- * The user's ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu become more powerful.\n- * The user can manipulate natural energy.\n- ** Those who have mastered the Sage Techniques of Mount Myōboku have shown the ability to turn the natural energy around them into an extension of their body to increase the reach of their attacks.\n- * The user can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to see them.\n- Users have at times been shown entering Sage Mode without this preparation.\n- * Because the user needs to move during combat, the senjutsu chakra cannot be replenished, which means the user can't stay within this state for extended periods of time.\n- Naruto states it is possible to lengthen the time limit.\n- * Another option is to employ shadow clones.\n- The clones can gather natural energy elsewhere and are dispelled when the energy is needed, thus transferring the gathered energy to the original.\n- For Naruto, this limited the number of shadow clones that he can have active at a time to five, for as long as the clones are gathering natural energy, creating any more than that would disrupt the clones' focus.\n- * If the user continually practices the use of their Sage Mode, then the time needed to recharge their sage chakra can be drastically shortened.\n- * If the user is also a jinchūriki that has achieved harmony with their tailed beast, they can drastically speed up their ability to gather natural energy in tailed beast mode to the point of only needing a few seconds to fully charge or recharge their sage chakra.\n- Tailed beasts can also assist their jinchūriki in gathering natural energy with their own chakra reserves.\n- The one exception is a dark pigmentation around their eyes and the eyes themselves, which usually differ based on where the user learned Sage Mode.\n- * Jiraiya was not able to properly balance his own chakra with natural energy, and as a result his appearance took on a number of toad-like traits when using Sage Mode: his nose grew bigger and gained warts, his teeth turned sharp, he grew a goatee, and acquired toad-like eyes.\n- Because of these traits, Jiraiya did not like to use Sage Mode as it \"displeased the ladies\".\n- Some of the physical alterations, such as the toad posture and the webbed feet, were beneficial and improved his manoeuvrability, and he could consciously manifest the alterations in order to take advantage of them.\n- * Naruto Uzumaki has yellow irides and toad-like pupils, with orange pigmentation around his eyes.\n- * Hashirama Senju had yellow irides, with black pigmentation around his eyes that extended to his ears, as well as an additional round marking on his forehead with a dot in its centre (red on the cover of Weekly Shōnen Jump 2014 Issue #9 , and green in the video game series as well as in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations ).\n- * Minato Namikaze had yellow irides and toad-like pupils, with orange pigmentation around his eyes.\n- * Koji Kashin has toad-like irides, with dark pigmentation around his eyes.\n- Amphibian Technique.png|Jiraiya's Sage Mode.\n- Naruto's Sage Mode.png|Naruto's Sage Mode.\n- Hashirama's Sage Mode.png|Hashirama's Sage Mode.\n- Minato's Sage Mode.png|Minato's Sage Mode.\n- Sage Mode Koji.png|Koji's Sage Mode.\n- By exposing their special body fluids to natural energy, they gain increased physical capabilities and the ability to perform various shape-shifting feats.\n- * Jūgo's skin tone darkens and his sclerae turn black.\n- He also gains a black stripe running from the middle of his forehead and down the bridge of his nose.\n- He receives a massive boost in overall ability, but loses his mind to his murderous side, signified by a change in his voice.\n- * Kabuto has yellow, snake-like irides and blackened sclerae, as well as purple pigmentation around his eyes that extends down to his shoulder blades.\n- His snake-like characteristics progress further in Sage Mode with him growing four horns, leading him to state that he had metaphorically transcended from a \"snake\" to a \"dragon\".\n- * Mitsuki gains a cyan chakra shroud that forms into ethereal snakes around his body to aid in his attack range.\n- A single horn juts from his forehead and he gains black markings (green in the anime) around his eyes.\n- Jūgo's Sage Mode.png|Jūgo's Sage Mode.\n- Kabuto's Sage Mode.png|Kabuto's Sage Mode.\n- Mitsuki's Sage Mode.png|Mitsuki's Sage Mode.\n- The red irides turn orange, and the slitted pupils characteristic of normal Nine-Tails transformations merge with the Sage Mode's eye pattern, creating a design reminiscent of a cross.\n- While using the combined form, Naruto gains simultaneous access to both forms' advantages, such as augmenting Tailed Beast Balls with senjutsu chakra.\n- Two years after the War, Naruto's skill with this form had increased to the point where he could fly within it, and easily shatter Truth-Seeking Balls during his battle with Toneri Ōtsutsuki.\n- * The sage training method used by the Toads of Mt.\n- Myōboku resembles the practices of Shugendō, a highly syncretic religion that originated in Heian Japan in which enlightenment is equated with attaining oneness with the kami.\n- This perception of experiential \"awakening\" is obtained through the understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature, centred on an ascetic, mountain-dwelling practice.\n- In some Japanese myths, supernatural creatures often appeared as Yamabushi (mountain hermits) of Shugendō, which the Toad Sages of Mt.\n- Myōboku and White Sage Snake bear some resemblance.\n- * In the anime, the term \"Honoured Sage Mode\" was only used by Jiraiya.\n- This was corrected to \"Sage Mode\" in later uses, presumably to create a distinction between Jiraiya's use of the technique.\n- * In the anime, before life on Earth had chakra with which to infuse it, the use of natural energy was called Sage Power (仙力, senriki ).\n- * In the anime, the snakes of Ryūchi Cave note that Boruto Uzumaki has the potential for senjutsu, having passed trials that proved his strength of body and could handle natural energy.\n"

Through the use of chakra flow, the user channels their chakra through their swords, extending both the reach and cutting ability of the blade, while allowing the user to fire crescents of chakra whenever the blade is swung.\n\n## Usage\n- This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of wakizashi, while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary.\n\n## Notes\n- This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles completely penetrated a considerable stone pillar, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings.\n- The samurai have also shown the ability to use shape transformation during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords, spiked shafts and even axes.\n- This transformational quality also appears to extend to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles that includes giant buzzsaws and shafts of chakra, the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.\n"

Unlike other clone techniques, the sand clone's composition is usually obvious at all times, only taking Gaara's shape and not his exact appearance.\n\n## Notes\n- Because of this, the clone can be reverted to sand at any time, most often when being attacked; as it's punched or kicked, Gaara can use the clone's sand to immediately capture the opponent's limbs.\n- Alternatively, Gaara can use the clone as a decoy, drawing opponents to it and once they're close enough, manipulating the clone's sand against them.\n- During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Gaara shows the ability to make a sand clone that looks exactly like the Third Tsuchikage rather than himself.\n- In this case, the sand clone he makes exactly resembles who they're based on, not being sand-shaped lookalikes of previous depictions.\n- Gaara is also able to hide other materials within the sand clones to be used against opponents who attack them, such as Gold Dust against the Second Mizukage's Steaming Danger Tyranny.\n"

The technique took three full days to complete if nine of the Akatsuki members were present.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- In the case of an unsealed tailed beast, the same thing happened to the beast itself, and still took as much time as if it were sealed.\n- After the process was complete, the beast was sealed within the statue, and one of the statue's nine eyes opened.\n- There is a numerical order, with the Nine-Tails needing be sealed last, or the statue would shatter.\n- However, with Nagato now dead, Tobi claimed that they would need a new pawn to synchronise with the Demonic Statue in order to seal the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- To prepare for the technique, Pain would summon the Demonic Statue, after which each member would then stand on one of its fingertips, corresponding to their specific ring finger.\n- Nine dragon-like effigies then poured from the statue's mouth, surrounded the captured host, and painfully removed the tailed beast from them.\n\n## Notes\n- Zetsu stated that if there are fewer people to perform the technique, it would take a while longer.\n- When performed, this technique caused the bit to fall out of the mouth of the statue.\n- Each of the Akatsuki members would then concentrate, causing the kanji of their rings to appear on the nail of the finger they were standing on.\n- The host would die due to the removal of their tailed beast.\n- Though Nagato intended to use it for peace in the form of a weapon of mass destruction to keep governments in line, the technique was created for Madara Uchiha's Eye of the Moon Plan, as Obito was tasked with ensuring that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the tailed beasts would become the Ten-Tails once more.\n"

This technique can also negate the effects of venom on the user's body.\n\n## Usage\n- The negative effect of using the core, should it be removed as the body became modified to depend on it for stability, the user's body will mutate uncontrollably.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The core can be moved around the body via hand seals, lowering the chances of its destruction.\n- Also, since Victor utilised a cursed seal to extend his life, prolonged usage of this technique would accelerate Victor's decline in health, as his over-usage led to his permanent loss of his right eye and leg and likewise leaves him extremely drained.\n- The efficiency of this technique depends on the user's skills, as neither Victor nor Orochimaru required hand seals to perform it, but while Victor's usage was considered imperfect, Orochimaru's did not show such flaws.\n- While Boro seems to be devoid of the flaws that Victor had, he was dependent on the core within his body to stabilise his regenerative powers, and he seemingly required to perform seals to purge the poison out of his body.\n\n## Notes\n- With the aid of a special core made from Scientific Ninja Tools, the technique can be augmented to activate instantly and even restore the person from the most maiming of damage, including getting their head obliterated, restoring them to their original form within seconds.\n- While stated to possess a regenerative ability in the manga, Victor's usage was never shown until the anime.\n- Similar to Boro's usage, Victor is capable of regenerating limbs and his head.\n- If a limb is severed, Victor can manipulate the limb or use his blood as tendrils to retrieve and immediately reattach it.\n- However, Victor's regeneration is not perfect as it is not capable of keeping up with inextinguishable Fire Release techniques.\n- Whether it is proper name or just a description of the type of technique is still unclear.\n- * While this technique does not regenerate clothing, in the anime when Victor's head was bitten off by one of Orochimaru's snakes, his eyepatch was included on his new head.\n- * In the anime, Boro claimed to his followers that he gained this power (regarding it as an \"indestructible body\") from a \"God\" he met.\n"

The barrier also prevents those outside of it from sensing anything inside it through traditional methods.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- However, Naruto Uzumaki transformed into his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and forced the Tailed Beast Ball to push the rest of the way through with B following, showing it could not withstand the assault of two jinchūriki.\n\n## Notes\n- The users can erect as much as 36 barriers, with the highest number being able to stop and contain any individual jinchūriki.\n- It proved to be strong enough to take a direct Tailed Beast Ball from Killer B, with only nine of the thirty-six barriers shattering.\n"

The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on.\n\n## Usage\n- The Multiple Shadow Clone Technique – which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens – is unsafe to the point of being forbidden.\n- They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity.\n- Although they are separate, shadow clones maintain small links between themselves and their original, intended to allow the user to reestablish control when needed.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * Sasuke Uchiha views Naruto's extensive use of shadow clones as a symbolic way to avoid loneliness.\n- * In Kakashi Hiden , while waiting for his new arm, Naruto creates shadow clones with a one-handed seal: a cross with his left hand's index and middle finger.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Although this allows him to have multiple conversations simultaneously, he has difficulty focusing on any one thing and the original Naruto becomes increasingly strained the longer the shadow clones are active; he drinks coffee and energy supplements in order to remain alert, but as soon as his concentration falters his shadow clones will all disperse.\n\n## Notes\n- Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous.\n- Because of this, usually only those of at least jōnin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique.\n- Naruto Uzumaki is an exception to this rule; because he has access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails, he can create hundreds of clones without worry.\n- s, seen with a Byakugan.]]\nUnlike the basic Clone Technique, shadow clones are physically real.\n- They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation.\n- Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created, but certain chakra constructs and complicated technology won't be duplicated.\n- Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, shadow clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by dōjutsu; Madara Uchiha can identify shadow clones using his Rinnegan.\n- Once created, shadow clones can serve a number of purposes.\n- If enough shadow clones are created, they can simply overwhelm an opponent, pinning them down or attacking from multiple directions.\n- or being sent to carry out tasks while the user is busy.\n- Shadow clones possess all the same memories as the user, and so will react to unforeseen obstacles just as the user would in the same circumstances.\n- Because they have their own chakra, shadow clones can perform other jutsu, including making more shadow clones.\n- Shadow clones usually disperse once they are struck hard enough, but they have been shown capable of enduring injuries for a time.\n- When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user.\n- Once dispersed, the clone's experiences and remaining chakra are transferred back to the user.\n- The shared experiences make shadow clones useful for intelligence gathering: a shadow clone can be sent into hostile territory, gather information without endangering the user, and disperse when finished, thus transferring what they've learned.\n- Alternatively, shadow clones can recon an area, dispersing when they've found what they're looking for in order to let the user know the target's location.\n- Kakashi Hatake discovered that shadow clones can also accelerate training periods.\n- For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses.\n- By using hundreds of clones, training that would usually take weeks or months can be completed within a few hours.\n- But because of how much chakra it takes to create just one shadow clone, and because the training itself will likely be arduous even without shadow clones, only Naruto can train in this way.\n- Naruto is indeed able to make effective use of this shortcut, but the combined experiences come with combined mental fatigue, requiring that he take regular breaks.\n- Users can exploit this link to network their clones, causing changes in their own chakra to extend to all the others.\n- While a user and/or their clones are performing tasks that require concentration, they're unable to have more than a few shadow clones active at a time.\n- In the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie , Naruto is consciously aware of what all his shadow clones around Konohagakure are doing.\n- * Madara Uchiha used a shadow clone to fake his death.\n- The clone apparently lasted indefinitely since the ruse was never discovered.\n- * In Naruto episode 129, Sasuke claims that the Sharingan can distinguish clones from the original.\n- This contradicts the manga and other anime episodes.\n- * The chakra of dispelled clones doesn't return to the user instantaneously, making it faster to Reverse Summon the clone to one's location to retrieve the chakra of faraway clones.\n- * In the anime, an ostrich named Condor appeared to use this technique, but in reality, it was just other ostriches.\n- * In the anime, the Genjutsu World's Hinata Hyūga can make shadow clones.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden episode 230, Naruto claims that his clones can dream.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden episode 365 (03:05), Naruto uses the Tiger, Snake, Tiger combination to create 3 shadow clones, the reason for which is unknown.\n"

It is accurate enough to even make the tentacles go through tiny holes.\n\n## Usage\n- Basically, this technique takes the user's own shadow and transforms and stretches it into countless thin tentacles, which are then used to grab objects and pull them in.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- There are no hand seals used for this technique, but the hand movements resemble that of Gaara's Sand Binding Coffin.\n\n## Notes\n- Also, one can skilfully make use of the tentacle-shaped shadow tendrils by using them to lift up and throw weapons like kunai and such.\n- This technique has many possible applications and uses.\n- That is, the final moves in strategy games like chess, shōgi, or Go.\n- This translation is almost as perfect as gathering in this case, since this technique was the final move in Shikamaru's shōgi-themed mission.\n- * In Naruto: The Broken Bond , Shikamaru used this technique in Part I.\n- * Shikamaru was shown training Shikadai in the basics of this technique.\n"

The Nara attaches their shadow to a \"host's\" own without restricting their movements, or forcing them to mimic their own movement.\n\n## Usage\n- This allows the host to move freely all the while the Nara's shadow is still attached to their own.\n- This technique allows for the Nara to bind multiple targets on a battlefield all while not directly engaging in combat, adding an element of surprise to their companion's attacks.\n\n## Notes\n- Through the shadow, the Nara is able to sense when their combined shadow comes into contact with the target's, basically using the latter's own shadow as an intermediary to link up other shadows in proximity, and they can then bind them with the Shadow Imitation Technique.\n"

By using these weapons to pierce the enemies' shadows, they are paralysed in place.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- To pierce the shadow, it is necessary to avoid the target just barely — Shikamaru added fake explosive tags when he used them against Kakuzu and Hidan to help with that.\n\n## Notes\n- Since it is more difficult for the enemy to notice it, this ninjutsu compensates for the weak point of the similar Shadow Imitation Technique, being its limited effective range.\n- It is unknown for how long this jutsu can keep its targets paralysed, however it can be disrupted simply by the removal of the blade or by the disappearance of the opponent's shadow.\n"

The user can stretch their shadow however they wish in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area; if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it.\n\n## Usage\n- Although most often used against opponents, the Shadow Imitation Technique can be used to save allies, freezing them in physically impossible positions so that they won't trigger booby traps or causing them to cling to sheer surfaces with no means of support.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- If a target is strong enough or if the user is weakened enough, targets can resist and even overpower the Shadow Imitation's control.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Keeping a target restrained requires a great deal of chakra, making it difficult to maintain the Shadow Imitation for long periods of time; in Part II, Shikamaru can only maintain it for five minute intervals.\n\n## Notes\n- But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range; Shikamaru Nara frequently uses flash bombs, either to briefly extend his own shadow or to extend his targets'.\n- Shikamaru Hiden clarifies that a user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in utter darkness.\n- Once a user merges their shadow with a target's, the target cannot move on their own other than to talk.\n- The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand.\n- Nara tend to wear their shuriken holsters in atypical locations so that, when they reach for and throw shuriken, their targets will reach for and throw nothing.\n- At times, the Shadow Imitation's mimicry is two-way, as if a third-party forces the target to make a move, the user will be forced to make the same move.\n- With repeated use or against multiple targets, the duration of the binding becomes shorter.\n- When that happens, Nara will inevitably use one of their other techniques, such as the Shadow–Neck Binding Technique or Shadow Sewing Technique.\n- The Shadow Imitation Technique was previously known as the , which was only capable of restricting targets' movements.\n- The imitation aspect was apparently not added until after Orochimaru defected from Konohagakure, as his Otogakure invaders did not know about it prior to the Konoha Crush.\n- Shikaku Nara still uses the old name sometimes.\n- * In the English dub of the anime, Sakon states that he mastered this technique.\n- * In the anime, Inojin Yamanaka tricked Metal Lee into believing that his ink snakes were this technique.\n- * In the Naruto: Clash of Ninja series, Kakashi can perform this technique by copying it with his Sharingan.\n- * In Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 , using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name \"Eight Way Shadow Imitation Technique\".\n"

There, the shadow can be used for restraint, replacing or adding to the binding of the Shadow Imitation; the closer the user is to their target, the stronger this binding becomes.\n\n## Usage\n- For this reason, it is most effective when immediately used to strangle a target, hence the name.\n- In The Last: Naruto the Movie , Shikamaru Nara uses the Shadow–Neck Binding to control the Ōtsutsuki clan's puppet, forcing them to fight among themselves.\n\n## Notes\n- Like the Shadow Imitation, the Shadow–Neck Binding requires a great deal of chakra to maintain, making it weaker over extended periods of time.\n- * In the anime, it was shown that this technique can be manipulated in a similar manner to the Shadow Sewing Technique.\n- * The technique appears in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm as Shikamaru's ultimate technique.\n- However, rather than strangling the opponent, it binds them to a nearby rock and then tightly squeezes them, destroying the rock and crushing the opponent.\n- * In Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 , using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name \"Shadow Sinking Technique\".\n"

The user changes the shape of their shadow into several sharp tendril-like needles and controls each separately.\n\n## Usage\n- This technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Shikamaru uses the special seal used in the Multi-Size Technique instead of the Bird seal, as the ring and little fingers were raised in the manga , but the index finger is raised instead of the ring finger in the movie.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.\n\n## Notes\n- They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads.\n- This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support.\n- After this technique hits someone, it can then be directly transformed back into the Shadow Imitation Technique; conversely, after immobilising the target(s) with the latter technique, a proficient user can then also transition so into the Shadow Sewing Technique to thereby subsequently inflict harm to the captured party.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5 , Shikamaru throws several explosive tags up in the air and uses this technique to pin them on his opponent.\n- The folded fingers are also interlocked in the manga, but not in the movie.\n"

Karura's love for Gaara was so great that, in death, her spirit possessed the sands and used them to protect him.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe.\n- It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: Karura truly did love Gaara and the Shield of Sand truly is her doing.\n- The Shield of Sand reacts to any attack against Gaara, even those Gaara himself is not aware of.\n- When he's about to be physically harmed in any way, the Shield of Sand moves between him and the threat in order to block it.\n- Though most often used in shielding Gaara from enemies, the sand also protects him from self-inflicted injury.\n- Because the shield is formed from sand that's been seeped in Gaara's chakra, it has a very fast response time, too fast for most enemies to overcome.\n- Some, such as Rock Lee and Sasuke Uchiha, are fast enough to outpace the sand, striking Gaara before it's able to shield him; it is against opponents such as these that he relies on his Armour of Sand for defence.\n- The combination of the armour and shield is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.\n- The Shield of Sand can protect Gaara against a great variety of threats, at different times defending him from kunai, taijutsu, Explosive Clay, to name only a few.\n- The sand itself is very good at absorbing the force from attacks, and so it is rarely even misshapen from the impact.\n- On those infrequent occasions when attacks do push against the shield, it places enough of a buffer between it and Gaara to stop the blow before it reaches him.\n- Even though the Shield of Sand ordinarily acts independently of Gaara, he is able to exert some control over it if he chooses.\n- He can fully surround himself with the shield, eliminating the chance of it being bypassed through sheer speed.\n- While he does this, he relies on his Third Eye to see what's going on outside, and then forms spikes from the shield to keep approaching enemies away.\n- In Gaara Hiden , Gaara uses his Magnet Release to mix \"sparkling metal particles\" into the Shield of Sand, fortifying it against attacks that would otherwise penetrate it.\n- Even Karura's will sometimes influences the Shield of Sand, shaping it into her likeness as it protects Gaara to remind him of her.\n\n## Notes\n- Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the Fourth Kazekage, tried to assassinate Gaara.\n- After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him.\n- In Part I, Gaara usually enters this sphere of sand while preparing to enter Tailed Beast Mode.\n"

Users can narrow the repulsion's direction, only pushing away things on certain sides so that nearby allies will be unaffected.\n\n## Usage\n- This repulsive force is most commonly created around the user as a defence, repelling nearby opponents or incoming ninjutsu; it can also be used to disperse ninjutsu that have already struck the user, such as Amaterasu.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- At its standard strength, opponents can resist Shinra Tensei by securing themselves to the ground: coating their feet with chakra to increase traction, digging in deeply enough to counter repulsion, or grouping together to minimise the repulsive force's influence.\n\n## Notes\n- Alternatively, the repulsive force can be created away from the user, destroying whatever is at the designated location.\n- Shinra Tensei's strength and area of effect are determined by how much chakra is used.\n- In its typical usage, it repels only within a few feet's distance and has enough force to destroy earthen constructs.\n- Shinra Tensei also exerts a recoil on the user.\n- If the opponent can withstand the repulsive force and force the user to use enough force, they can turn Shinra Tensei against the user.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble , an enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called can be performed.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Sasuke can use Shinra Tensei while he is in his Complete Body — Susanoo form.\n- * In the manga, Kaguya attacks Naruto and his clones with a repulsive force by extending her hand, but the name of the jutsu used is not mentioned.\n- In the Jump Force game, where the ability is seen again, it is confirmed to be Shinra Tensei.\n- * In the anime, Momoshiki repels a burst of Fūma Shuriken through a jutsu with repulsive capabilities, but does not mention its name.\n- Even so, the jutsu in question has the same characteristics as Shinra Tensei, is used through the Rinnegan and Momoshiki has demonstrated that he meets the necessary requirements (being able to manipulate the five basic nature transformations).\n"

To make full use of the body, the user ideally transmits their chakra from the highest and closest point possible so that they can have the best possible range.\n\n## Usage\n- Once their chakra enters the body, they are given complete control of it, allowing them to decide all of its actions, its use of jutsu, and even speak through it.\n- As a representation of this control, the controlled bodies' eyes take on the same appearance as the user's.\n- Some of the Six Paths Techniques are very chakra-taxing, and in order to use them Nagato must either bring the respective body closer to his position or alternatively cut off control of the other five Paths and focus all of his chakra into the one.\n- Sensors can track the chakra Nagato spends to control the paths back to him, exposing his real location.\n- Obito controls his Six Paths using a single black receiver embedded into the left side of each of their chests, which were hidden from view.\n- * While talking to Tobi about the Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation technique, Kabuto Yakushi uses the term to refer to the six bodies Nagato used to fight Jiraiya.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The pods are also numbered from one through six using daiji characters and are ordered counter-clockwise around the room with a numbering scheme that corresponds with the ordering of the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation:\n* - Deva Path.\n- He also seals their respective tailed beast back into their bodies, which he maintains control of through the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.\n- Each of these Paths, or realms, represents one of the realms a being is reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Nagato's first Six Paths of Pain were composed of individuals that Jiraiya had met when they were alive.\n- Each of the Six Paths of Pain can be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself is capable of, however, he limits each body to one branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the exception being Yahiko's body (the Deva Path) through which he performs a number of miscellaneous jutsu; the King of Hell and the creatures summoned by the Animal Path are part of his shared vision.\n- Because of his lack of mobility, Nagato requires a great deal of preparation time to use his Six Paths of Pain, especially when moving outside his usual residence in Amegakure.\n- The greatest weakness of his Six Paths of Pain is that each body has only one primary ability; if an enemy has prior knowledge of what body does what, they stand a better chance of defeating the Paths.\n- Obito can force the jinchūriki to transform into their full Tailed Beast Modes, but this carries an increased risk of the beasts subverting his commands.\n- Because of how much effort it requires to keep six tailed beasts under his control at once, Obito does not channel the Six Paths Techniques into his Six Paths of Pain.\n- * Three of Nagato's Six Paths of Pain are playable in Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3 , while the other three appear as support characters.\n\n## Notes\n- Inoichi Yamanaka compared this technique to the Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Switch Technique, albeit on a greater scale.\n- In the anime, the first body used, belonged to his childhood friend Yahiko, which was his favourite.\n- To match his late friend's hair colour, he had the other Paths' hair dyed to the same colour, including eyebrows.\n- Nagato implants their black receivers all over their bodies as body piercings.\n- Nagato refers to each body by the Path it embodies and has them serve specific purposes, be it offensive or defensive, reconnaissance or repair.\n- Each of the Paths has its own importance in a fight – the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths making it the most valuable – and therefore, Nagato will sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up the hierarchy.\n- This is usually mitigated by Nagato's frequent changing of his chakra signature.\n- It took Naruto stabbing himself with one of Nagato's black receivers to create a direct connection to track him with his Sage Mode sensing.\n- When not in use, Nagato stores the bodies in a hidden chamber within Amegakure's tallest tower.\n- Within the room are six \"pods\", in which the bodies rested; each pod is connected to the wall via pipes or wires and has a sliding cover that appears to feature the symbol of Amegakure, which conceals the face of the inactive body.\n- * - Asura Path.\n- * - Human Path.\n- * - Animal Path.\n- * - Preta Path.\n- * - Naraka Path.\n- When transformed into the tailed beast, the receivers move from the chest to the neck.\n- Rather, he uses the same abilities that they had when they were alive, such as Rōshi's Lava Release and Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu.\n- With Obito's Sharingan, through which he sees what his Paths see, he is able to more precisely synchronise and deploy their abilities.\n- While the two lower Paths, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher Paths, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be Paths of suffering because they perpetuate the cycle of Reincarnation; the only way to break it and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\n- The latter had a female voice as it was a woman.\n- All six are able to appear simultaneously in three-versus-one match-ups.\n- The playable ones are Deva, Asura and Animal, the ones whose primary function is battle, rather than support.\n"

Hagoromo is able to grant Six Paths Senjutsu to others, as he did with his son, Asura, and later with his son's reincarnate, Naruto Uzumaki.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only techniques of the highest level have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by Daytime Tiger without harm.\n\n## Notes\n- It can also be obtained by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, as taking in the power of the nine tailed beasts is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.\n- As a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to Sage Mode, though the user's sensing capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of Limbo.\n- They also gain a complete comprehension of chakra, including the ability to use all five basic nature transformations and make perfect use of Yin–Yang Release, as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.\n- When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Obito and Madara Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general.\n- The two were entirely immune to the effects of ninjutsu, only being vulnerable to senjutsu and taijutsu, though techniques utilising Six Paths Power could also damage them.\n- They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds, with Madara even claiming to be immortal.\n- Obito was capable of producing chakra arms from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the Four Red Yang Formation with ease.\n- Despite not previously possessing the kekkei genkai, Madara was able to use a Storm Release technique, which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.\n- Naruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his Six Paths Sage Mode, a form which he received from Hagoromo.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , the cloaks worn by Hagoromo, Hamura, Madara (as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki) and Naruto (in Six Paths Sage Mode) are known as .\n"

Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.\n\n## Usage\n- * The , which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.\n- * The , which allows the user to summon a wide variety of creatures.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * The , which is capable of absorbing all forms of chakra, including most ninjutsu.\n- Each of these \"paths\" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Nagato, who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of black receivers.\n- The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.\n- As the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble , a technique called \"Six Paths Technique\" is used by Nagato's Six Paths of Pain.\n\n## Notes\n- Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:\n\n* The , which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.\n- * The , which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.\n- * The , through which the user can call upon the King of Hell.\n- * The , with which the user is able to preside over life and death.\n- These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations.\n- However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale Shinra Tensei, or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of Chibaku Tensei.\n- In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.\n- It also does not seem that the user is able to change the Path being utilised by each body, as once each of Nagato's Six Paths were taken down, he could not channel any of their powers through the remaining vessels.\n- While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate Saṃsāra, the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\n- The Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term Tīrthika , refers to any doctrine that \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment.\n- This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the , and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\n- He then created a black rod out of his will and told Obito to use it when he performed the Six Paths Technique.\n- In this variant, Nagato generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor.\n- An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called can also be performed.\n"

After a Rinnegan user performs the required hand seals while in close proximity to the Ten-Tails, the beast is quickly absorbed into the user's body.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Madara Jinchuriki anime.png|Madara's initial transformation after using the seal.\n- Madara's New Form.png|Madara's transformation with the Ten-Tails' tree form absorbed also.\n- While it is unclear whether this was the jutsu used by Hagoromo to seal the Ten-Tails into himself, it is possible that this was the technique mentioned by Obito.\n\n## Notes\n- If they are able to find that strength of will, they'll obtain the power of a \"god that shapes the land\", essentially acquiring the power of the Sage of Six Paths.\n- Madara's regenerative powers and durability are also greatly enhanced, able to survive the left side of his torso being obliterated or being bisected and soon after completely restore himself.\n- With his immense regenerative powers, Madara claimed he had achieved complete immortality.\n- Obito Second Transformation.png|Obito's final transformation.\n- * Madara placed the Forbidden Individual Curse Tag on Obito, which interfered with his ability to become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, until Obito later managed to remove it.\n- * The Truth-Seeking Balls created through this technique are said to be similar to Tailed Beast Balls.\n- * Jin no Sho describes this technique as making the user's body into a yorishiro , an object with which to attract and house a deity.\n- * Alongside the Limbo: Border Jail, Madara could not use this technique as a reincarnated corpse.\n"

Their seals, however, are not as powerful as the Heaven and Earth seals, although they have similar end results.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Jirobo stated that utilising the second stage of the Cursed Seal makes them ten times more powerful than before.\n- However, Sakon comments that after using their cursed seal's second level and coming out of it, they lose a lot of energy.\n- Later, in Part II of the anime, it was revealed that Orochimaru enhanced the power of their cursed seals, giving them the ability to use the Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover, a technique capable of trapping the souls of the user and the victim within an untraceable barrier, to fight with little to no interference.\n- Jirōbō Cursed Seal Lv 2.png|Jirōbō's cursed seal; second level.\n- Jirōbō's cursed seal is the only one not seen before it is activated.\n- When the second level of his seal is active, his skin turns maroon, his hair grows longer, and he also grows warts on his forehead and shoulders.\n- Kidomaru Cusre Mark 2.png|Kidomaru's cursed seal; second level.\n- Kidōmaru's cursed seal, seen only in the anime, is formed like a hook (placed with the sharp end down) with two tags at the end of the upper part.\n- When the second level of his seal is active, his skin turns deep red, his hair grows longer and turns a light greyish colour, and he grows horns on his forehead and his elbows.\n- Tayuya Curse Mark 2.png|Tayuya's cursed seal; second level.\n- Tayuya's cursed seal consists of three hooks, similar to a triskelion on the back of her neck.\n- When the second level of her seal is active, her hair grows longer, she grows five oddly-placed horns on her head, slightly resembling a crown, and her skin turns dark brown.\n- Sakon and Ukon Curse Mark 2.png|Sakon and Ukons' cursed seal; second level.\n- Sakon and Ukon both have the same type of cursed seal, which consists of three circular dots placed like a triangular shape on their foreheads.\n- When the second level of their seals are active, they resemble goblins with red skin, longer hair, a single horn (on opposite sides for each brother), and can grow black armour from their bodies (from the side where they separate).\n\n## Notes\n- The technique however, would result in the user's death.\n- In the cases of the Sound Four, who were reincarnated, they were able to survive the usage of this technique, though their souls returned to the Pure Land when the barrier was broken.\n- However, the pattern that spreads during its first state are like chains of triangular arrows.\n- He most greatly resembles an ogre in this form.\n- He claims his strength increases ten times, to the point where he can single-handedly lift a gigantic Chōji Akimichi.\n- He becomes more spider-like, almost oni-like in appearance in this form.\n- By opening the third eye on his forehead, his accuracy increases to the point of pinpointing Neji Hyūga’s Byakugan blind spot from a distance of over 50 metres.\n- This increase in strength and precision allowed him to use the destructive archery technique, Spider War Bow: Terrible Split.\n- The horns grow when she exerts herself.\n- Her strength increases, to the point of breaking free of the Shadow Imitation Technique.\n- They can also extend their fusing abilities to someone other than each other, and tear their opponents apart on a cellular level.\n"

It was utilised by the reincarnated Sound Four releasing their hatred within their cursed seals.\n\n## Notes\n- The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier.\n- Sensor ninja and even the Byakugan cannot sense and see through this technique respectively.\n- The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops.\n- To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra.\n- Inoichi Yamanaka likens this to a genjutsu cancel.\n- Inside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know.\n- Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end.\n- As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die.\n- However, it sacrifices the lives of the users so the targets can be trapped and the users' malice is not blocked by the barrier so a ninja who can sense ill will can locate the barrier and break it, freeing the souls trapped within, while the users' disappears.\n"

When released, the seal will either spread across the user's face or wrap around their entire body.\n\n## Usage\n- It represents the third eye which allows one to see past the mundane world and into the divine world.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The seal will permanently remain in the centre of the user's forehead, presumably so that the user can keep on benefiting from its effects.\n- This seal is also symbiotically linked to the summon Katsuyu, to either perform widespread healing of people, or communicating with the slug over long distances.\n- That is to say: the power of the techniques used by Katsuyu, is directly proportional to the reserves of the seal.\n- By releasing the power of their seals, Tsunade and Sakura were able to combine its power with the Creation Rebirth technique in order to gain access to the Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique.\n- While the Strength of a Hundred Seal seems to be modelled after this in terms of appearance, it is currently unknown if hers is also a Strength of a Hundred Seal.\n- * In the chapters published in Shōnen Jump , the seal was initially identified as .\n- * Tsunade also uses a portion of the seal's chakra to maintain her youthful appearance.\n- * Due to similar appearances, Sarada Uchiha speculates there exists a connection between this seal and Kāma.\n\n## Notes\n- The stored chakra is then released into their body, greatly amplifying the power of their techniques.\n- * Mito Uzumaki had a similar marking on her forehead.\n- It was corrected in the tankōbon version.\n- ** In the anime, Tsunade stated that because of the delicate nature of building up chakra required for this technique, a person is substantially drained of normal reserves of chakra, making it dangerous for one to perform surgery or battle.\n- Sakura, however, found a way to divert a small portion of that built-up chakra back into her normal reserves.\n- * Mitsuki claims Orochimaru has researched it, finding it to have a long and poorly understood history.\n"

It allows him to assume the identity of any individual for a variety of purposes: though similar in nature to the standard Transformation Technique, it boasts far greater utility.\n\n## Usage\n- Typically, White Zetsu would employ his parasite clones to serve as substitutes; he was able to control these clones remotely and remained aware of their actions and experiences.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- * In both the manga and anime, the transformed clones were shown to bleed when damaged.\n\n## Notes\n- In becoming the perfect duplicate of another individual, he will even possess chakra identical to that of the one that he is impersonating along with any clothing they might be wearing or tools they may be carrying.\n- The clones can also use this technique to copy a target's abilities.\n- The transformed clones can even retain the appearance of the person they were impersonating after death, reverting to its true form only after the technique was voluntarily released by the original White Zetsu.\n- Unlike the original's version, the technique is seemingly dispersed once the transformed soldier is dealt with a significant amount of damage or killed.\n- Additionally, these clones demonstrated the ability to partially revert to their true forms while transformed.\n- However, in Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie , limbs severed from transformed clones were shown to leak a white substance, similar to Obito Uchiha's artificial arm.\n- One clone was also shown to regenerate its lost limb upon reverting to its true form.\n"

It allows the caster to instantaneously shrink themselves or any nonliving matter within their field of vision (or return the same to full size) at will.\n\n## Usage\n- Daikokuten can be used to store shrunken objects within an alternate dimension where time does not flow, allowing them to maintain a pristine condition.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- He also uses the jutsu to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints.\n- He is still able to use Kāma's absorption in his shrunken state.\n- He can also use the shrinking effect defensively against that which Kāma cannot absorb, such as reducing natural (non-chakra) flames that were engulfing him to a small size.\n\n## Notes\n- Because the change in size happens too fast for the human eye to see (and the shrunken size can be exceedingly small), use of the jutsu can easily be mistaken for teleportation.\n- The technique cannot, however, be used on oneself if one is physically paralysed.\n- Isshiki Ōtsutsuki utilised Sukunahikona while on the verge of death after being betrayed by Kaguya, to enter the body of Jigen, which allowed him to survive as a parasite before ultimately taking over the monk's brain.\n- Isshiki employs Sukunahikona in combat by shrinking his projectile attacks to keep his enemies from defending against them and then restoring them to their original size to inflict critical damage.\n- The shrinkage is not limited to an object's entirety, as Isshiki can shrink a section of the target object, such as causing a building to cave in or removing a section of a rooftop.\n- While inhabiting Jigen's body, this jutsu demanded that Isshiki make hand gestures in order to shrink foreign matter, but in his original form, Isshiki can achieve the effect merely by looking at desired objects.\n- *While Isshiki could not shrink living beings, he was able to shrink Jigen's body while still inhabiting it.\n- This could be because his own body was attached to Jigen's, making it an extension of his.\n"

      "markdown": "# Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu\n- Class: Supplementary\n- Users: Kabuto Yakushi, Orochimaru, Tobirama Senju\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game\n\n## Summary\nThe Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation is a jutsu that binds the soul of a deceased person to a living vessel, restoring them as they were in the last moments of their lives in order to do their summoner's bidding. It was originally created by Tobirama Senju, some time after which he declared it a kinjutsu.\n\n## Usage\n- In general, this limited control is not an issue for the summoner, and they will typically \"deactivate\" the reincarnation, placing them in a coffin for storage and transportation until they're needed.\n- In order to actually be able to control their actions, the user must implant a special talisman - generally attached to the end of a kunai - within the reincarnation's brain.\n- The talisman's design determines how strong the control is:\n* At its most basic, the reincarnated souls retain their personality, giving them the freedom to approach a given task however they like so long as it broadly carries out the summoner's bidding.\n- The summoner instead controls all of their actions, even permitting them to speak through the reincarnation or summon other reincarnated souls to their location.\n- Orochimaru prefers this level of control.\n- Kabuto has at times rewritten talismans remotely in order switch to this level of control when the situation calls for it.\n- If the summoner chooses to, they can rejuvenate the reincarnation while planting their control talisman, restoring their complexion and reducing some of the imperfections; this is merely aesthetic and the signs of decay do not inhibit their abilities.\n- Reincarnated members of Akatsuki are, however, outfitted with different cloaks than they used to wear.\n- Yin–Yang Release, as manifested in Truth-Seeking Balls, can negate the regenerative properties of reincarnated bodies, reducing their effectiveness and, if used to strike a vital spot, kill them for all intents and purposes.\n- Kabuto can regain control of Itachi by gaining access to the control talisman, and in fact is still able to release him from the Impure World Reincarnation.\n- This grants them full control of their own actions, all the benefits of an immortal body, and prevents the summoner from releasing them from the Impure World Reincarnation.\n- Another way to take over the control of reincarnated bodies is through the usage of the Six Paths Technique, as in the case of Obito's Six Paths jinchūriki.\n- Because of Obito's Black Receivers being embedded into the left side of each jinchūriki's chests, he was able to wrest Kabuto's control over the revived jinchūriki, and thus control the revived jinchūriki's near-perfectly.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- However, when the perfected Impure World Reincarnation is used to revive somebody, there comes a possibility that they will be strong enough to resist this control; Tobirama was able to resist this control prior to Orochimaru using Hashirama's cells to strengthen the binding and Orochimaru notes Hashirama Senju could break free if he chose to, even with the enhanced binding from Hashirama's cells.\n- Kabuto and Orochimaru are able to strengthen the bindings they use through external means: Kabuto siphons chakra from the cursed seal Anko Mitarashi is branded with; On a related note, any level of control creates a traceable chakra signature between the reincarnated soul and their summoner, allowing reincarnated sensors to trace the summoner's location.\n- An unavoidable characteristic of a reincarnated body is the darkened sclerae, with a soul that retains its personality having grey sclerae and a soul with a suppressed personality having black sclerae.\n- The reincarnated jinchūriki similarly have their respective tailed beasts sealed back into them.\n- There are only three guaranteed ways to end the technique: (When demonstrating the technique to Tobi, Kabuto lied that the seals to release it are Dog → Horse → Tiger .)\n# A less reliable, though equally effective method is to have the reincarnated soul be affected in some emotional way that gives them closure, allowing their soul to break free of the Impure World Reincarnation's influence.\n- During the Fourth Shinobi World War, the Allied Shinobi Forces develop the method of binding the reincarnations' bodies so that they can't move and then placing a seal on the bindings so that they no longer pose a threat.\n- The Benihisago and Kohaku no Jōhei are able to seal the reincarnated bodies to such a degree that even the release of the jutsu won't affect the seal.\n- Itachi also used his Sword of Totsuka to seal Nagato, his ultimate fate unclear after Itachi had Kabuto released the technique.\n- Conversely, if the reincarnated soul knows the hand seals, they can sever the summoner's contract with them; in the anime, the seals are Snake → Ram → Boar → Dog → Tiger .\n- * In the anime, when eradicating the personality of Hanzō, Kabuto used several hand seals instead of just one.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Despite its risks, Kabuto prefers this level of control.\n- Reincarnated bodies do not bleed, except in those cases where blood is needed to perform the Summoning Technique.\n- Other side-effects may still manifest, as when Itachi Uchiha's eyes bleed from using his Mangekyō Sharingan, but he is not inhibited by it.\n- Madara Uchiha describes this as \"the one risk of the technique\".\n\n## Notes\n- Orochimaru would discover the technique decades later and improve on its use, while his subordinate Kabuto Yakushi nearly perfected it.\n- Kabuto remarks that this basically amounts to grave-robbing, although blood stains or organs salvaged after the target's death also work.\n- A living sacrifice is also required for the reincarnated soul to use as a vessel.\n- If the souls are readily available in the Impure World, such as was the case with the first four Hokage who were freshly freed from the Shinigami's stomach, they can be reincarnated through this technique.\n- Reincarnations can be recalled in a similar way, with a coffin emerging around them to take them back.\n- After first performing it the user is only able to restrict their movements.\n- On the one hand, this makes them more useful in combat because they know how best to use their own abilities and, if deployed against somebody they knew when they were alive, there is a possibility for psychological warfare.\n- On the other hand, although they are compelled to do as their summoner wishes and act without reluctance, they can undermine their summoner to a degree, either by making poor decisions that opponents can take advantage of or by giving opponents advice about how to defeat them.\n- * At its strongest level, the reincarnated soul's personality is entirely eliminated.\n- Although this guarantees the reincarnated soul will only ever act as desired, they are less resourceful and it requires the summoner's attention for every action that must be taken, making it difficult for them to multi-task depending on the circumstances.\n- A reincarnated individual will have all the abilities they had during their life, including kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.\n- They are physically restored as they were at the time of their death, including any physical handicaps they may have possessed, such as Nagato's damaged legs.\n- Exceptions exist: illnesses they had will not be preserved, nor will any physical damage that contributed to their death.\n- There is some inconsistency of whether or not foreign body matter will be restored as well: Hanzō retains the poison gland of the black salamander, but Madara Uchiha does not have access to Hashirama Senju's genetic material and thus Kabuto must artificially reproduce it for him.\n- Clothing is reproduced according to what they wore when they died, although it is merely a superficial aspect of their reincarnated body; armour offers no actual protection, being of the same ashen material as the rest of their body.\n- Weaponry is usually not retained and must instead be gathered by the summoner; the reincarnated Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist only have access to those swords Kabuto is able to acquire.\n- One exception seems to be the Gold and Silver Brothers' Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths, which are still seemingly stored within the brothers' bodies.\n- The vast majority of the reincarnated were able to achieve the same power they had at life, such as Mū.\n- But a few of the reincarnated, such as Madara Uchiha’s full abilities were limited by the technique.\n- For example, even with the perfected Impure World Reincarnation; Madara's reincarnated body is successfully bound by the Sage Art: Gate of the Great God, which he easily breaks free of as soon as he is restored to life.\n- Likewise, there are some things a reincarnated body simply cannot do, such as access all the abilities of the Rinnegan or become the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.\n- Any damage they receive will regenerate in time and, assuming the damage is not too debilitating, they can continue attacking even before their body recovers.\n- This was one of the main purposes Tobirama created the technique for, as he would use one or more reincarnated souls to perform a series of Kamikaze-like attacks until the opposition was wiped out; he created the Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags specifically for this purpose.\n- A second benefit is the limitless refilling of their diminished chakra reserves that the reincarnated individuals have access to; they can fight eternally and perform ordinarily physically demanding or chakra-intensive jutsu without issue, knowing their current reserves will infinitely refill.\n- or only being able to create a certain number of clones.\n- The reincarnated body can be further enhanced to \"beyond their prime\".\n- When Madara Uchiha was brought back, Kabuto put his body through a selective evolution, combing the best attributes from different points of his life.\n- In addition to his body being restored to its physical prime rather than the withered state it had when he died, he also retained the various abilities he gained only during the last years of his natural life; he retained the graft of Hashirama Senju's DNA so he could still access the First Hokage's abilities, and he has access to dōjutsu he gave up during his life.\n- Reincarnated individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- When a soul is released from the Impure World Reincarnation, their body disintegrates back into dust and the sacrifice's corpse will be left lying in the debris.\n- The soul may linger briefly - with their personality restored if it was being suppressed - to leave parting words or take final actions.\n- Souls released by their summoner will be enveloped in light throughout the process.\n- Even if the Impure World Reincarnation cannot be broken conventionally, reincarnated bodies can still be neutralised.\n- The spirits of those reincarnated by the technique will remain damaged even if the jutsu is released, as shown with Minato Namikaze.\n- There are also other instances of a reincarnated body escaping their summoner's influence.\n- Itachi Uchiha was targeted with Kotoamatsukami by Shisui's eye transplanted into a crow which was stored in Naruto, displacing Kabuto's commands with different orders.\n- However, it should be noted that Kabuto is still able to release them from the Impure World Reincarnation.\n- Name\n!\n- Village of origin\n!\n- Sacrifice used\n|-\n| Hashirama Senju || Konohagakure || Kin Tsuchi/White Zetsu clone\n|-\n| Hiruzen Sarutobi || Konohagakure || White Zetsu clone\n|-\n| Minato Namikaze || Konohagakure || White Zetsu clone\n|-\n| Osoi (Anime only) || Kumogakure || Konohagakure shinobi\n|-\n| Third Kazekage (Anime only) || Sunagakure || Unknown\n|-\n| Tobirama Senju || Konohagakure || Zaku Abumi/White Zetsu clone\n|-\n| Yota (Anime only) || Unknown || Unknown\n|}\n\n;Notes\n* During the Konoha Crush, Orochimaru attempted to reincarnate Minato Namikaze, unaware that his soul did not reside in the Pure Land.\n- For that reason the summon failed.\n- * In the anime, Kabuto's reincarnation of Chūkaku and Heiji are accidents, as he intended to reincarnate Chiriku and Hanzō, respectively.\n- ** Kabuto deploys these and other mistaken reincarnations to try and release more important reincarnations from their bindings.\n- As most are no stronger than genin, they all fail.\n- In the anime, the failed reincarnations are represented by piles of sand.\n- In Naruto: Shippūden , the eyes are corrected to match the manga.\n- * Starting in Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations , Kabuto Yakushi (Snake Cloak Form) uses the Impure World Reincarnation as his ultimate technique.\n- He summons Kakuzu, Itachi, and Deidara, who attack the opponent using the Lightning Release: False Darkness, Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, and C1, respectively.\n- * In Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls , Ryūki claimed to have redesigned this technique as a means to communicate with the dead without actually sacrificing anyone.\n- This was ultimately a lie to gather sacrifices for his goal in gaining immortality from Jashin.\n- * In the anime within Tsunade's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream, Sasori used this technique to revive an army of shinobi puppeteers, which could all use Red Secret Technique: Performance of a Hundred Puppets.\n- * In Sasuke Retsuden: The Uchiha Descendants and the Heavenly Stardust , Zansūru claimed that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant of Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu.\n- Decades prior to Sasuke's time in the Astronomy Research Institute, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama's Impure World Reincarnation.\n"

In the case of the toads, the contract is a scroll that the summoner signs their name to using their own blood and further marks with the fingerprints of one of their hands.\n\n## Usage\n- Similarly, any person who has summoned Kurama must continually provide their own chakra in order to keep it under their control.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Koji Kashin has summoned the flames from the in battle, as their non-chakra origin prevents them from being absorbed.\n- Like with seals, these formulae are a random assortment of Kanji, Hindi script, and other symbols.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- * In the anime, when the Animal Path performed the Summoning Technique onto Ibiki Morino's abdomen, it caused him tremendous pain as the Giant Drill-Beaked Bird burst forth from his backside.\n\n## Notes\n- Orochimaru has the snakes' contract tattooed to his arms, which he smears with blood each time he wants to perform a summoning.\n- A user can summon different species provided they have signed the respective contracts, as Sasuke Uchiha is able to summon snakes and hawks while Konohamaru Sarutobi can summon toads and monkeys.\n- Contracts remain active even after death, allowing those revived with the Impure World Reincarnation to perform summons they established when they were alive.\n- To actually summon an animal, users apply some of their blood to the hand they signed the contract with.\n- Usually they bite one of their fingers to accomplish this, but blood from injuries elsewhere on their body can also be used.\n- They press the hands' five fingers down and channel chakra to the hand, summoning the animal to that location.\n- While usually pressing them at the ground, it is also possible to do so on no surface at all, such as midair.\n- The amount of chakra gathered in the hand determines the size and number of animals that are summoned: if too little chakra is offered, only a small, young animal will be summoned; Two people who have signed the same contract can pool their chakra to summon especially large animals.\n- If an individual has access to the blood of someone who has signed an animal's contract, they can use the blood to summon the animal; the individual will need to provide their own chakra, however.\n- Animals are typically summoned in order to lend assistance to their summoner, either by carrying out tasks or joining them in combat.\n- Summoners will sometimes use their summons as a base for other jutsu, as with Summoning: Food Cart Destroyer Technique and Summoning: Quick Beheading Dance.\n- Summoned animals are not actually required to do anything and may choose instead to harm their summoner; Manda routinely threatens to kill his summoners.\n- Animals can even refuse their summoner's attempt to summon them by sending another of their species in their place.\n- Animals are not summoned indefinitely and will return to wherever they were summoned from when they tire out and/or enough time has passed.\n- Summoners can take advantage of this by riding along when their summon returns home, granting them a quick means of escaping an area.\n- Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki — the originator of the Rinnegan — is able to summon five people and the nine tailed beasts from Kaguya's Dimensions, though he needs the chakra of seventeen dead Kage to do so.\n- It is also possible to summon naturally occurring, non-sentient phenomena.\n- * A is produced at the hand's location when a summoning is performed.\n- * Animals can summon those who have signed contracts with them using the Reverse Summoning Technique.\n- * Kurama can apparently identify who is trying to summon it, something other summons have not been able to do.\n- * In the anime, Shiromari is summoned for a fifty year period because of a scroll left by its summoner before they died.\n- When the scroll was destroyed, Shiromari was finally able to return home.\n- * In the Naruto: Shippūden anime, attempting to summon an animal without first signing a contract teleports the user to the home of the animal they have a natural affinity for.\n- In the Boruto anime, attempting to do this simply results in failure.\n- * In the anime, Summoning animals were in high demand for shinobi that researchers on the Summoning Island committed to research to enhance these animals, before creating the Ultimate Summoning Beast that turned on them all.\n"

The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice.\n\n## Notes\n- The walls of the oesophagus are sticky and pliable, making it difficult for opponents to keep their footing and, therefore, fight as normal.\n- The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.\n- In the anime, Jiraiya demonstrates the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique.\n- This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic poison that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect.\n- Though it can be endured in small amounts, this poison begins to paralyse a person's entire body after ten minutes of continuous exposure, indiscriminately affecting anyone contained within the stomach.\n- Naruto's own wallet is a reference to this word as well.\n- * In various video games, parts of the oesophagus also spew fire.\n"

The technique requires two summoning seals to be completed, and these gates serve the same function as the single Rashōmon, but with triple the defence.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The defensive capabilities of this technique are further boosted by the lack of hand seals required to perform this technique.\n\n## Notes\n- The first gate takes the attack head-on, the second reduces the attack's power and the third disperses the pressure, causing all attacks that come in contact with it to lose their power before they can be effective.\n- The defensive capabilities of this technique was able to protect Orochimaru from dying from a Tailed Beast Ball, which he stated would have killed him had he taken that attack head on.\n"

The moment the brush is removed from the scroll, the images leap from the paper, grow to life-size, and act according to the user's will.\n\n## Usage\n- In addition to the animals it is normally used to create, Sai can produce explosive tags.\n- Smaller variants can be used to carry explosive tags or be used to deliver messages.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Sealing Technique Tiger Vision Staring Bullet.png|Tiger - as with lions, this tiger be used to swarm a target and attack.\n- Also used for sealing his enemy.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Ink Mouse.png| - can be used as ropes to restrain someone.\n- * In Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles , Rock Lee was able to paint mice with the head of Might Guy.\n- Tenten painted a large, \"cute\", humanoid bunny and panda bear.\n\n## Notes\n- Because they are made of ink, a single blow is usually enough to dispel them.\n- For discreet communiques while undercover, Sai is able to turn the words he writes into small animals, allowing them to travel unnoticed to the intended target, after which the ink animal requires a scroll to revert back into written information.\n- In the anime, for the drawings to retain stability upon emerging, the user's emotional state must have a true passion for them.\n- Otherwise, the drawings will immediately splatter.\n- They are usually created in small groups as - can be ridden for reconnaissance or high-speed travel.\n- With the ability to soundlessly enter through even the smallest crevice, they can also be used for assassination purposes.\n- Super Beast Imitating Drawing - Dragon.png| Appropriately, his design is named .\n- Despite this, in the anime, Sai was shown using this technique to create a fish and an umbrella.\n- Sai still had to perform the technique to animate their drawings.\n- * In the anime, Inojin uses coloured ink for his Super Beast Imitating Drawing creatures in addition to the black ink Sai uses.\n- * In the anime, Sai noted that Boruto Uzumaki's passion and love of his drawings could possibly make him well-suited for this technique.\n- * In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 9, Nine-Tails, Inojin's use of this technique is called Super Beast Cartoon Drawing (超獣戯画, Chōjū Giga ).\n- Whether this is a mistake or a new jutsu is unknown.\n"

      "markdown": "# Susanoo\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Mangekyō Sharingan, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu,\n- Class: Offensive, Defensive\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Indra Ōtsutsuki, Itachi Uchiha, Kakashi Hatake, Madara Uchiha, Sasuke Uchiha, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki~anime, Merz~game~~with~artificial Sharingan, Shisui Uchiha~game\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie canon\n\n## Summary\nSusanoo is the strongest ability available to those who have awakened the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes, having been passed down through the Uchiha Clan's generations. It manifests as a gigantic, humanoid avatar made of the user's chakra, which surrounds them and fights on their behalf.\n\n## Usage\n- The latter characteristic can be used against the user; if an opponent can bypass Susanoo, however slightly, and latch onto them, they may be forcibly pulled out of Susanoo.\n- It can be used as a projectile and can explode into massive pillars on lightning large enough to engulf Kurama.\n- Susanoo inherited his father's sword Totsuka no Tsurugi, which Izanagi used to kill his newborn son, Kagu-Tsuchi after his birth burned his mother, Izanami, to death.\n- After his exile for his relentless harassment of Amaterasu, Susanoo redeemed himself when he used Totsuka to slay the serpent Yamata no Orochi and obtained the Sword of Kusanagi from the monster's corpse.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- This connection allows Susanoo to be a shield against physical attacks, one that becomes more difficult to penetrate as it is manifested more fully.\n- Sasuke uses the chakra from Jūgo's Sage Transformation to make a , with markings reminiscent of the Cursed Seal of Heaven spreading across it.\n- The Sword of Totsuka is an ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade that, in addition to standard cutting, can seal anyone it pierces, trapping them in a genjutsu-like \"world of drunken dreams\" for all eternity.\n- In its primary left hand, Itachi's Susanoo wielded the Yata Mirror, a shield that can change its nature depending on the attack it receives, thus nullifying it.\n- Its primary weapon, though, is a bow, manifested on the wrist of its left arm; the bow can double as a shield, a function that becomes more visually apparent in its armoured form.\n- Curiously, his armoured Susanoo appeared to always form the Tiger hand seal with its front hands, and was the largest of its variation.\n- He could also use Susanoo: Blade of Yachihoko to absorb the chakra from all those affected by the Engraved Tsukuyomi in order to increase the size of his sword, and repair any damage to his Susanoo unlike other users, though doing so took some time.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Sasuke Uchiha describes the sensation of using Susanoo as feeling pain in every cell in his body, which only increases over time of usage as well as at higher developmental stages.\n- Being a Mangekyō Sharingan-based ability, it also places a strain on the user's eyes the more it is used, however, it is not actually necessary for one's Mangekyō Sharingan to be active while using Susanoo; in fact, Madara Uchiha is able to use it without any eyes at all.\n\n## Notes\n- By default, Susanoo is anchored to its user and they to it: in its less developed forms it will move around with the user; in its more completed forms the user will be suspended within Susanoo, being brought with it as it moves around.\n- Although Susanoo is quite effective as a defence, it is able to distinguish in what it blocks.\n- For example, the user can still perform jutsu while within Susanoo, such attacks being able to pass through it to the outside without complications.\n- Others can be brought within Susanoo with the user's permission, and users can likewise choose to leave Susanoo's protective structure.\n- With continued mastery, Susanoo can have increased defensive capabilities even at its ribcage stage, as seen when A was able to crack a rib of Sasuke's Susanoo, but conversely, could not crack Madara's.\n- If it is damaged, Susanoo does not regenerate and it can only be repaired either by advancing it to the next developmental stage or by dispersing it and then forming it anew.\n- Also, Susanoo is also only able to defend against physical attacks, so they are still vulnerable to visual or auditory attacks for example.\n- Additionally, unless the legs of the Susanoo are fully manifested, the user's still vulnerable to attacks from below.\n- Susanoo draws on the user's chakra in large amounts so long as it is active.\n- Practised users go through all the stages every time they manifest it, layering more advanced stages over earlier ones or stripping them away as is needed; they can choose to stop at any developmental stage.\n- At its simplest level, users only manifest aspects of Susanoo's skeletal structure, such as a ribcage for basic defence or an arm for interacting with the surroundings.\n- Once a full skeleton is made, musculature and, later, skin forms until finally a complete humanoid is shaped.\n- In these early stages, typically only the upper half of Susanoo is materialised, with legs becoming common once it reaches its full humanoid form; however, not all Susanoo users can accomplish the latter feat.\n- In its next stage, armour forms around the humanoid for further protection, causing it to resemble a yamabushi.\n- In its final stage, users stabilise the chakra that comprises Susanoo to create a colossal form known as the , the ultimate ability of the Mangekyō Sharingan.\n- In this state, Susanoo gains a tengu-like nose, wings for flight, and is clad with robes and ornate armour.\n- This form is generally the size of a tailed beast, with the exception of Hagoromo's, which was roughly the size of the Ten-Tails.\n- This form also possesses power comparable to that of a tailed beast, capable of levelling giant mountains and, when enhanced by Six Paths Chakra, small planetoids with ease.\n- Users can also channel their own techniques into the Complete Body — Susanoo, as well as shape it around the Nine-Tails to improve its offensive and defensive capabilities.\n- Users are able to mingle the chakra that makes Susanoo with chakra from other sources.\n- He later stores the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, drastically improving its strength and causing lightning to emanate from its back.\n- Some features are consistent, however, all Susanoo constructs are deviations of the Japanese tengu, and have two sets of arms — one of which can form wings as part of its Complete Body form — and six fingers on each of its hands.\n- All Susanoo wield at least one sword.\n- In its humanoid form, its face was framed by locks of hair, with an appendage on its chin reminiscent of a Pharaoh's false beard.\n- When its armour was formed, Itachi's Susanoo resembled a long-nosed tengu and it wore a pair of magatama earrings.\n- Itachi's Susanoo possessed a curved blade that resembled a dagger or tantō.\n- He rarely used this, preferring his Sword of Totsuka, wielded in its primary right hand and sheathed in a sake jar held by its second right hand.\n- According to Black Zetsu, the simultaneous use of the Sword of Totsuka and the Yata Mirror made Itachi essentially invincible.\n- In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Itachi has an exclusive Complete Body — Susanoo form that retains the traits of his previous forms, including a retractable version of the Yata Mirror, and a broadsword version of the Sword of Totsuka.\n- Itachi's Susanoo.png|Itachi's skeletal Susanoo.\n- Itachi Humanoid Susanoo NXB.png|Itachi's humanoid Susanoo.\n- Itachi Armoured Susanoo NXB.png|Itachi's armoured Susanoo.\n- Susanoo Itachi complete.png|Itachi's Complete Body — Susanoo, game only.\n- Because Sasuke's development has often been marked by intense feelings of hatred, his Susanoo is noted to be much darker in composition compared to Itachi's.\n- Whereas Itachi's Susanoo appears relatively \"normal\", Sasuke's possesses demonic horns, a long appendage on its chin, and a malevolent grin.\n- Its armoured form initially appears largely the same as Itachi's save for having jagged teeth around its hood.\n- After Sasuke gains the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan, however, its appearance changes, the armour's mouth taking on a beak-like shape and generally becoming ghastly-looking.\n- In its Complete Body form, Sasuke's Susanoo has a helmet that features a long tengu nose, two spikes over each eye, a slit stretching across its mouth, three gaps on each of its cheeks and one additional gap on its chin.\n- Like Madara's, it is massive, comparable in size to Kurama after Naruto Uzumaki got Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's chakra.\n- Because of his Rinnegan, Sasuke can use the wings of his Complete Body Susanoo to block out the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi (and in Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections the Engraved Tsukuyomi).\n- When drawing on the power of the tailed beasts, the armour of his so-called is reduced somewhat, exposing the humanoid within.\n- This form is capable of generating a sword instead of having it form alongside the Complete Body — Susanoo, enabling him to catch opponents off guard.\n- Sasuke's Susanoo has a blade in all its forms: a sabre in its developmental forms, an ōdachi in its humanoid form, wielded with its second right hand, and finally a pair of katana in its Complete Body form.\n- Weapon properties can be augmented, either with black flames in its armoured form or lightning in its Complete Body state.\n- Sasuke is able to perform techniques through his Susanoo, such as Chidori and Great Fireball Technique.\n- Sasuke's susanoo.png|Sasuke's skeletal Susanoo.\n-

Sharingan version).\n- Sasuke's Flying Susanoo.png|Sasuke's Complete Body — Susanoo.\n- Tailed Beast Susanoo.png|Sasuke's Indra Susanoo.\n- His Susanoo was made up of two entirely different sides that were conjoined along their spine, both of which had a distinct face: the front face had elongated canine teeth in its lower jaw bracket and two tusks growing from said jaw, while the back face had similarly elongated canine teeth in its upper jaw bracket and a single horn protruding from its forehead.\n- In its armoured form, the usual tengu-like armour splits from its forehead down, revealing Susanoo's eyes while obscuring the rest of its face.\n- In its Complete Body form, its head gained a long tengu nose and two lines running down from its mouth to its chin area, as well as hair which was tied up at the sides, and dwarfs a mountain-sized meteor that he had brought down on the Fourth Division during the war show it was at least several hundred meters tall.\n- Madara's Susanoo wielded distinct, undulating blades that resembled kris, held in the right hand of each side.\n- He was able to throw the blades as guided projectiles.\n- In the anime, Madara was able to manifest swords in all four of Susanoo's arms; the blades left traces of blue, fire-like chakra in the ground after impacting and could unleash shockwaves capable of obliterating numerous shinobi in a single strike.\n- In its Complete Body form, the swords more closely resembled traditional katana or tachi, complete with sheaths held in the secondary arms.\n- One of the swords could cut cleanly bisect several mountains with a single stroke and from far away.\n- For long-range attacks, Madara could use Susanoo to perform Yasaka Magatama.\n- Madara incomplete ep368.png|Madara's skeletal Susanoo.\n-

Storm 4 , Shisui has an exclusive Complete Body — Susanoo form, complete with a second pair of wing-shaped arms, tengu like features, and wielding a large drill-like sword.\n- Susanoo Shisui Humanoid.png|Shisui's humanoid Susanoo.\n- Susanoo Shisui complete.png|Shisui's Complete Body — Susanoo, game only.\n- The Susanoo he uses has only been seen in a Complete Body form.\n- It had the characteristic tengu nose, a forehead protector-like plating on its head, two locks of hair falling on either side of its face, a hole in its chin, and a vertical mark extending across its left eye, similar to Kakashi's own signature scar.\n- It wields a katana, but its most notable weaponry are the Mangekyō-shaped shuriken that can warp away targets on contact.\n- Kakashi's Susanoo.png|Kakashi's Complete Body — Susanoo.\n- Two locks of hair fell on each side of the face and a single horn protruded from the chin, resembling Hagoromo's facial hair.\n- It possessed a sharp tengu-like nose and a jagged mouth, giving it a demonic appearance.\n- His Susanoo was much larger than other users, reaching a size comparable to the Ten-Tails.\n- Hagoromo Susanoo.png|Hagoromo's Complete Body — Susanoo.\n- This allowed him to use Susanoo, surprising Sasuke Uchiha.\n- His Susanoo had some minor visual differences from that of other Susanoo users, as it was more skeletal in appearance, and its back and arms were covered in black flames resembling those of Amaterasu, while its blade was coated in red flames.\n- Having trained to master the eyes, Merz's Susanoo was a Complete Body — Susanoo.\n- By tapping into Nanashi's chakra acquired through Yachihoko, it took a gargantuan size, dwarfing even Sasuke's Susanoo and Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode.\n- With his Susanoo, Merz could use Yasaka Magatama, and fend off a weakened Majestic Attire: Susanoo from Naruto and Sasuke.\n- He was born from Izanagi washing his nose.\n- He later gave the acquired blade to Amaterasu as a peace offering.\n- * Susanoo's designs are based on , well known yokai that are associated with the ascetic practice of shugendō .\n- In their final forms, the Susanoo are garbed in the attire of shugendō practioners, known as yamabushi , and wear hoods that resemble tengu masks, with Itachi's and Madara's appearing as long-nosed Hanataka Tengu and Sasuke's as a crow-billed Karasu Tengu .\n- In Japanese myth, Susanoo produced the fiend Amanozako who is said to have been the progenitor of the Tengu.\n- * Madara's Susanoo design may be influenced by , a human-like being described in the as having one body with two faces back-to-back, each with its own set of arms and legs.\n- * The is one of the , together with the Sword of Kusanagi and the .\n- * Itachi's Susanoo carries the Sword of Totsuka in a gourd.\n- An ethereal weapon inside a gourd could be a reference to the hyōtan-kozō, a gourd spirit from Japanese folklore.\n- * Susanoo's skeletal stages also resemble the , a yokai composed of the vengeful souls of fallen soldiers who were not properly buried, taking the form of a skeleton fifteen times the size of a regular person.\n- Its appearance and weapons were changed to match the manga in subsequent appearances.\n- * Although the third databook states that the user must first unlock Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu before they can gain Susanoo,\n* Sasuke's humanoid Susanoo bears a great resemblance to Raideen the Brave, one of a number of Yoshiyuki Tomino references in the series (another being the Gundam -derived names of Kakuzu's techniques).\n- * Shisui's Susanoo resembles the eponymous mecha from the anime Steel Jeeg .\n- * Despite Madara, Indra, Sasuke and Kakashi all being shown to manifest a stabilised Susanoo in the manga, only Madara is listed as a user of the Complete Body — Susanoo in the fourth databook.\n- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , Madara's Susanoo swords are capable of spinning, giving them a drill-like ability.\n- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Itachi and Shisui's Susanoo are given Complete Body — Susanoo forms, designed by Kishimoto himself, making it so all known Susanoo users have access to its highest form across different media.\n- Also in the game, Madara's Limbo clones possess the ability to use Susanoo, while Madara himself, empowered as the Ten-Tails jinchūriki, was shown using a larger form of the Complete Body — Susanoo.\n- For an Ultimate Jutsu, the version of Sasuke from The Last: Naruto the Movie manifests a Susanoo arm in the place of his own missing arm.\n- * Indra's Susanoo was given its unique name in Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu .\n"

Users must gather and balance this chakra in their mouths, shape it into a sphere (or a conical shape in the case of the Ten-Tails), and then fire it at their target; Gyūki likens this to vomiting.\n\n## Usage\n- As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Obito Uchiha is able to form multiple Tailed Beast Balls at once via a tree he creates, each of which can fire in a different direction.\n\n## Notes\n- Most users fire their Tailed Beast Balls as-is, while others may consume the ball and fire it from their mouth as a beam, focusing the attack on a narrower area instead of letting it detonate all around upon impact.\n- Gyūki is even shown doing something in between, not consuming its Tailed Beast Ball yet still firing it out in a wave.\n- There is no limit to how much chakra can be put into a Tailed Beast Ball so long as the 8:2 ratio is maintained: Kurama has shown to be able to create a Tailed Beast Ball many times bigger than itself when using even a fraction of its chakra.\n- Tailed Beasts can also combine their Tailed Beast Balls to form it into a very large one.\n- Tailed Beast Balls are incredibly dense, so much so that despite being suspended in the air, they instantly crater the ground beneath the user due to their extreme weight.\n- Despite how heavy they are, they move at an incredible rate once fired.\n- When used by the Ten-Tails, the Tailed Beast Ball was able to cross several miles in only a few seconds.\n- Tailed Beast Balls are very destructive, creating explosions that are visible from incredibly far away and that vaporize almost everything in the blast area.\n- The extent of the damage is dependent upon how the ball is fired and how much chakra it has.\n- Its \"standard\" size is enough to easily vaporize mountains.\n- The power of the Tailed Beast Ball is shown to even dwarf islands, however, Kurama and Gyūki have been shown to cause immense damage, such that the devastation dwarfed entire mountain ranges and could be felt across the continent.\n- Tailed Beast Balls are comparatively weaker if a jinchūriki uses one without entering their Tailed Beast Mode, yet it is still potent enough to represent a serious threat to people and infrastructure.\n- Some jinchūriki are shown using Tailed Beast Balls in atypical ways.\n- Naruto, when using his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, can form a Tailed Beast Ball with his hands, similar to how he makes the Rasengan.\n- He can also add natural energy to his Tailed Beast Balls, increasing their power and potency, while also allowing them to be used against Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- In the anime, Sora uses an entirely white Tailed Beast Ball while transformed under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra.\n- Himawari Uzumaki is able to form a Tailed Beast Ball incredibly quickly from her mouth and hair which act like tails, making her resemble a miniature Kurama in her usage.\n- Being incarnations of the Ten-Tails, the sentient God Trees have been shown to have the capability of using the Tailed Beast Ball.\n- Unlike the tailed beasts and jinchūriki, Jura formed a Tailed Beast Ball from his right Rinnegan.\n- Naruto vs.\n- Kurama.png|Fired as a beam.\n- Gyuki's Bijudama.png|Fired as a wave.\n- Jura's Tailed Beast Ball.png|Fired from an eye.\n- Himawari's Tailed Beast Ball.png|Fired from hair.\n- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Gyūki performs a Lightning Release version of this technique.\n- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , Saiken performs a variation of this technique utilising Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu.\n- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Naruto and Sasuke perform a variation of this technique wherein the Tailed Beast Ball is coated with Sasuke's Amaterasu and the Tailed Beasts' specific chakra types are added to the ball.\n- This was used against Madara Uchiha's gigantic Chibaku Tensei.\n- Killer B observes that the process for forming a Rasengan is exactly the same as forming a Tailed Beast Ball, with its chakra rotation acting as a substitute for the tailed beast form.\n- In the anime, it is formed from positive blue chakra and negative red chakra, and the completed ball is purple.\n- In some instances, it is depicted taking on a red colour upon being fired.\n- ** In J-Stars Victory VS , Naruto's Tailed Beast Ball uses the manga's colour scheme, but glows yellow upon being fired.\n- * Shukaku is the only tailed beast not seen using a Tailed Beast Ball in the manga.\n- However, it does so in an anime-only dream world created by the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Orochimaru is capable of using a similar attack when using his Eight Branches Technique.\n- * In the anime, one of the Infinite Tsukuyomi's dream worlds depicts the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path using this technique.\n- * In Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze , Kido Tsumiki has access to the Tailed Beast Ball via the usage of his Tailed Beast Drug.\n- However, while powerful, his Tailed Beast Ball is noted to be nowhere near as powerful as ones coming from a true Tailed Beast.\n"

The jinchūriki will use the raw chakra of their Tailed Beast to form arms, which they can freely manipulate to attack their foes, able to strike an opponent faster than even a Sharingan user can react to.\n\n## Usage\n- Not only that, Naruto can control each individual shroud he gives out to protect his allies.\n- He instead uses his sand control to shape existing sand into arms.\n\n## Notes\n- The chakra arms' hands are clawed while the rest of the arm seems to lack any kind of joint, thus allowing them to have flexible movements that will generally be impossible for normal arms.\n- The user can create any number of arms that they desire and they can also serve other purposes such as grappling hooks, to either grab onto objects or enemies from great distances, for offensive means, as merely touching one of these can cause fatal burns, due to the Nine-Tails' seething hatred within its chakra (though this is not always the case).\n- Due to having chakra attached to his body, the chakra arms can grow in size and from the fourth tail up, Naruto, the arms, or any part of his body can divide into two or more fully operational appendages.\n- Killer B has also been shown to use this technique though instead of arms, he can form horns which he uses for his Lightning Release: Lariat technique.\n- In his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto can use the chakra arms to a greater extent, as he can use and release chakra arms from anywhere on his body on a small or large scale.\n- These arms even have the power to crush stone without Naruto putting much thought into it.\n- In the anime Naruto was able to crush a sword with a chakra arm just by tightening his grip.\n- After some practice, he mastered the chakra arms, able to manipulate various stones and geometric shapes without crushing them.\n- Now he is able to use them in an attempt to create a new technique: the Tailed Beast Rasengan since he was advised by the Eight-Tails against the use of shadow clones in this form.\n- Naruto's mastery of the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms is so great that he is able to create several at once to launch attacks at several enemies, use them to pull enemies into the attack, and even create tiny ones around his finger.\n- The arms also grant him a greater level of dexterity and manoeuvrability out of what would normally be a helpless situation, such as guiding his Rasenshuriken during his fight against the Third Raikage.\n- He has shown similar techniques when he does slip into his Shukaku forms.\n- * In Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze , Magire and Kido Tsumiki created a Tailed Beast Drug that allowed them to use the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms.\n- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Card Battle , Naruto's powerful blows in Jinchūriki Form are known as .\n"

It attempts to use the Rasengan's form to create a substitute for the Tailed Beast Ball.\n\n## Usage\n- * In the anime-exclusive Power arc, Naruto managed to create an incomplete yet effective Tailed Beast Rasengan (before he had absolute control of the Nine-Tails' chakra) which was able to petrify his Nine-Tailed clone.\n\n## Notes\n- At the start of his training, Naruto finds some difficulty making the ratio of black and white chakra 8:2.\n- Despite the fact that Naruto was in his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he still sustained injuries on his hand when practising the technique.\n- Naruto asks Killer B to watch and tell him when he has got the ratio right so he can remember the feel of the technique.\n- Naruto has also noted that this new Rasengan is quite heavy, as he can barely hold it up.\n- This is likely because of the Nine-Tails' chakra, which has been described as very dense in previous instances.\n- According to Killer B, he has almost perfected it, and the best way to learn and master it was from real-life experience on the battlefield.\n- Later, during the Fourth Shinobi World War, after gaining Kurama's cooperation, Naruto gained the ability to use the Tailed Beast Ball, and subsequently, developed the Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, leaving the completion of this technique unnecessary.\n"

As they descend in succession along the same trajectory, if one of these meteorites is stopped, the user can summon another one to then collide with the first, ensuring that they crash into their intended destination.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * In the anime and video games, the hand seal held by Madara changes from the manga to be a Ram seal instead of a Snake seal.\n\n## Notes\n- The impact of this technique was of such enormity that it devastated a significant portion of the Fourth Division, with the resulting tremors felt from the border of the Land of Lightning to as far away as the Allied Shinobi Forces' headquarters.\n- It was also able to completely destroy Madara's Susanoo, and obliterate his body.\n- ** As a nod to Madara's own body being affected by this technique, the latter game while with no direct damage involved, can allow Madara and his ally to be affected by the blast radius of the second portion as friendly fire (which however does not add any combo hit counts unlike hitting enemies with it).\n- * The sheer enormity of this technique caused the Fourth Division to question if it could even be called ninjutsu, with Gaara believing it to be a power comparable to a god's.\n- * After becoming the Ten Tails' jinchūriki, Madara's usage of Chibaku Tensei created several meteors similar to the ones this technique summons.\n- * When the second meteor first dropped, it looked almost perfectly spherical, but when Madara awakened his Complete Body Susanoo from his armoured Susanoo, it looked elongated vertically.\n"

Said to represent the , it is the antipode to Amaterasu.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Because of the power of the Mangekyō Sharingan and the speed with which Tsukuyomi works, normal methods of countering genjutsu are ineffective against it.\n- Sharingan users can briefly resist unconsciousness, In Akatsuki Hiden , Itachi theorises that love can be used to revive victims, his reasoning being that, since Tsukuyomi destroys the spirit, feelings that reconnect the spirit can undo Tsukuyomi; Kodaka does indeed do this in order to resuscitate his younger brother, Kiiro.\n\n## Notes\n- he uses Tsukuyomi to subject victims to days' worth of torture in a matter of seconds; examples include continual stabbing or reliving traumatic events over and over.\n- Tsukuyomi's illusions are usually represented as an inverted grey scale; in the anime, there is usually also a red moon in a red sky.\n- Using Tsukuyomi requires a great deal of chakra, making it inadvisable for Itachi to continue fighting after using it.\n- However, victims of Tsukuyomi have it far worse, as they are ordinarily rendered comatose as soon as Tsukuyomi's illusion is completed.\n- According to Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night , \"the time that passed within this genjutsu was one one-hundredth of one one-thousandth of one one-millionth of that of the real world.\" In the novel, Itachi uses Tsukuyomi on Izumi Uchiha, causing her to live through decades of a happy life in the span of a few moments.\n- When she dies of old age within the illusion, her actual body dies as well.\n- He is one of the \"three noble children\" (alongside the sun goddess Amaterasu and the sea and storm god Susanoo) born when Izanagi cleansed himself of defilement after escaping from the underworld, with Tsukuyomi born when Izanagi washed out his right eye.\n- According to the Nihon Shoki , Amaterasu's wrath over Tsukuyomi's killing of the goddess of food led to the sun goddess refusing to ever look at Tsukuyomi's face again, forever moving to another part of the sky while Tsukuyomi's fear of his sister's wrath makes him hide during the day (hence explaining why day and night are separate).\n- According to some modern interpretations, Tsukuyomi is thought of as a god of time, or at least of the calendar; the basis for this is the interpretation of \"moon reading\" as reading the movements of the moon, an act paired with reading the calender(=day), and the verb being used in the Man'yōshū and other books to refer to counting the days of the month.\n- This connection may be referenced by Itachi's ability to manipulate a victim's sense of time within Tsukuyomi's dreamscape.\n- It's unclear if the genjutsu he ends up using is in fact Tsukuyomi, as such a form of information-gathering is usually done with Genjutsu: Sharingan.\n- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm , Itachi uses Tsukuyomi by having the red moon crush the opponent while the image of the moon warps into a copy of his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n"

Using the Puppet Technique to manipulate them at will is what is known as the method.\n\n## Usage\n- These puppets are very powerful, as Sasori claimed that there were rumours that they had been used to take down an entire castle at one point in time.\n- Though it displayed no weaponry or hidden mechanisms, it had huge fists and immense striking power which Chiyo used to fend off attackers.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Puppet 10.PNG| Puppet 10 : The final puppet had one eye, and was capable of releasing an orb from its mouth used for the Sealing Technique: Lion Closing Roar.\n\n## Notes\n- With this puppet collection it is literally possible to use one puppet with each finger — each boasting a power matching a thousand puppets put together.\n- However, to use all of these secret mechanisms demands extremely high-class expertise and skill.\n- These ten puppets were created by the first puppeteer Monzaemon Chikamatsu and later came into Chiyo's possession, the use of which earned her great fame.\n- The Chikamatsu Collection has terrifying prowess in taijutsu, ninjutsu, bukijutsu, and so on.\n- Furthermore, as they can change their numbers by combining, the number of abilities they can show becomes even greater.\n- The puppets were constructed in such a way that they all can work in tandem with each other both offensively and defensively.\n- It always kept closer to Chiyo in case it was needed as defence while she operated the other puppets.\n- Puppet 2.PNG| Puppet 2 : This puppet had grey markings around its mouth area and hair coming from a single point on its head.\n- It was shown to have colossal fists and fierce taijutsu skills.\n- In the anime it was able to extend its arms to form a sort of cage to trap opponents, where it would then launch four small bombs from its mouth.\n- Since the explosion was accurate and very small, it dealt a great amount of damage to enemies whilst not damaging the cage.\n- Puppet 3.PNG| Puppet 3 : This puppet had a red face with white hair.\n- It was used in conjunction with the black-haired puppet.\n- It is able to lift a section of its face to reveal a spinning orb with four large chakra blades.\n- Since these blades are made of chakra and spin rapidly, even a scrape can prove deadly.\n- It is wielded like a weapon by its partner.\n- Puppet 4.PNG| Puppet 4 : This puppet had long, black hair and works in conjunction with the red puppet.\n- It is able to extend its hand via a chain, connecting with its partner's hand to hurl it around like a yo-yo, thus being able to slice through targets quickly and effectively.\n- However, if one were to be destroyed, the other would become vulnerable.\n- Puppet 5.PNG| Puppet 5 : A bald puppet with large holes in its skull.\n- This puppet's hidden weapons are the long extending cables coiled in its skull that can pierce numerous enemies at a time.\n- Since the range is very long, it can pierce distant targets without even getting close.\n- Also, it is able to latch onto opponents with its cords and then crumble them slowly.\n- It can also use taijutsu to fight, but lacks brute force.\n- Puppet 6.PNG| Puppet 6 : This puppet had spiky hair and the lower half of its face was green in colour.\n- It had the kanji for in its mouth, and worked in conjunction with the Buddha and Dharma puppets to use the Three Jewels Suction Crushing technique.\n- Puppet 7.PNG| Puppet 7 : This puppet had a ponytail, a beard, red markings under its eyes and the kanji for in its mouth, and worked with the Buddha and Sangha puppets to use the Three Jewels Suction Crushing technique.\n- Puppet 8.PNG| Puppet 8 : This puppet had white hair and large sideburns with the kanji for in its mouth which activated the Three Jewels Suction Crushing technique when used in conjunction with the Dharma and Sangha puppets.\n- Puppet 9.PNG| Puppet 9 : This puppet was modelled after a female with red hair tied into buns.\n- It wielded two large broad-swords and was capable of cleaving through enemies with ease, although the sheer size of the weapons reduced the puppet's dexterity somewhat.\n- This puppet was one of the main attackers, and could fend off even the strongest of enemies at an alarming rate.\n"

There is also chakra flowing through the lengthened hair, making its hardness comparable to that of steel wire.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Its name may come from the fact that, as seen just before striking Pain, it takes the shape of what resembles a lion's mouth.\n\n## Notes\n- By thickly bundling the hair, its strength is further increased, also increasing its destructive power.\n"

In an attempt to retrieve the chakra bestowed upon her two sons, she imparted her will upon the God Tree and — along with all the people tethered to it — created what then became the Ten-Tails.\n\n## Usage\n- Created as a malleable construct, Black Zetsu is capable of controlling the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and taking possession of them.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Immediately prior to being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki formulated a plan that would result in her eventual revival.\n- This allowed Madara to remotely control Obito's actions using his chakra, as well as fire black rods out of his body as projectiles, though Obito was ultimately able to resist his control.\n\n## Notes\n- Titanic in size, she was able to use its power to fight her children for a length of months.\n- To accomplish this, she created a sentient being known as Black Zetsu, which would spend centuries fulfilling her desire.\n- Once the remnants of her chakra were finally reunited, Black Zetsu was able to revive her within a new host, Madara Uchiha.\n- It was also capable of manipulating the husk of the Ten-Tails, extracting a number of White Zetsu from it.\n- Moments prior to his death, he attempted to infuse his will into the right half of White Zetsu, seemingly creating Black Zetsu, which he referred to as a weaker version of himself; in actuality, Black Zetsu merely made it look like it was being created as part of its plan.\n- Madara was actually able to impart his will into the black rod that emerged from the flowering tree he was attached to in his old age.\n- Revealing it to Obito, Madara claimed that it was a physical manifestation of his will and that it should be used when performing the Six Paths Technique.\n- On a later occasion, following his resurrection, Madara caused a number of these black rods to emerge from Obito's artificial right half, which became entirely coated in a black substance similar to Black Zetsu.\n"

Yin Seal: Release opens that seal, giving the user access to the accumulated chakra.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Upon release, a pattern starts to appear from the diamond shape, by spreading the seal's pattern to another, the user can transfer the seal's chakra to them instead.\n\n## Notes\n- The stored chakra amounts to far more than what the user has on their own, allowing them to perform chakra-demanding jutsu that they wouldn't be able to use otherwise, such as Creation Rebirth.\n"

The openings can be used to connect two different spatial locations within the same dimension, or to create a pathway that links two dimensions together.\n\n## Usage\n- These portals can be used to transport only sections of the user's body by partially entering them, allowing the user to grab their opponents and drag them into the portal, sending them to another location.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * Obito Uchiha was able to synchronise his Kamui with Kaguya's Yomotsu Hirasaka to gain access to her six dimensions.\n\n## Notes\n- By entering these spacial tears, the user is able to retreat, disorient enemies, or execute ambush attacks at a moment's notice.\n- Kaguya Ōtsutsuki used this technique to travel between her six dimensions.\n- Kaguya can also open rifts to transport her attacks through the portals, relocating projectiles and ultimately taking the enemy down by surprise.\n- The portals are manifested at such speeds that even a shinobi as fast as Sasuke Uchiha was caught off guard.\n- However, evading the portals is still possible.\n- * In the anime, this was the first jutsu used on Earth.\n- * Black Zetsu was able to use this technique while residing inside the sleeve of Kaguya's severed arm.\n- * At times, Urashiki Ōtsutsuki activates his Rinnegan before using this technique, though he can also use it without doing so.\n"
