      "markdown": "# Six Paths Senjutsu\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Classification: Senjutsu\n- Class: Offensive, Defensive, Supplementary\n- Users: Ten-Tails, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Hamura Ōtsutsuki, Asura Ōtsutsuki, Obito Uchiha, Madara Uchiha, Naruto Uzumaki\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie canon\n\n## Summary\nSix Paths Senjutsu is a special form of senjutsu used by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki — the Sage of Six Paths — as well as his younger brother, Hamura. Hagoromo is able to grant Six Paths Senjutsu to others, as he did with his son, Asura, and later with his son's reincarnate, Naruto Uzumaki.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only techniques of the highest level have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by Daytime Tiger without harm.\n\n## Notes\n- It can also be obtained by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, as taking in the power of the nine tailed beasts is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.\n- As a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to Sage Mode, though the user's sensing capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of Limbo.\n- They also gain a complete comprehension of chakra, including the ability to use all five basic nature transformations and make perfect use of Yin–Yang Release, as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.\n- When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Obito and Madara Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general.\n- The two were entirely immune to the effects of ninjutsu, only being vulnerable to senjutsu and taijutsu, though techniques utilising Six Paths Power could also damage them.\n- They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds, with Madara even claiming to be immortal.\n- Obito was capable of producing chakra arms from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the Four Red Yang Formation with ease.\n- Despite not previously possessing the kekkei genkai, Madara was able to use a Storm Release technique, which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.\n- Naruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his Six Paths Sage Mode, a form which he received from Hagoromo.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , the cloaks worn by Hagoromo, Hamura, Madara (as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki) and Naruto (in Six Paths Sage Mode) are known as .\n"

First, a halo of bright energy spreads around the user's hands as this technique is activated, then it encircles the user's hand and from that, the beams are shot out towards the enemy.\n\n## Notes\n- The user is able to alter the beam's direction after being shot, making it possible to strike multiple enemies with pinpoint accuracy, even bypassing hostages held in close proximity.\n- The user can also increase the number of beams to a great amount to pin down an enemy.\n- Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as 'Reiza Sakaso'.\n- * In the anime, the beams disconnect from their source in Darui's hands.\n- This has never happened in the manga and was corrected in a later episode.\n"
