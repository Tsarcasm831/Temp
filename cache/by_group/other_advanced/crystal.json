    "summary": "The Living Corpse Reincarnation is a technique that was developed by Orochimaru that allows him to transfer his soul to someone else's body. It is also referred to as the \"Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique\".",
    "technique": [
      "By repeating this process periodically, this effectively allows the user to remain in the realm of living, so long as they can keep the host body alive while residing within.",
      "Orochimaru then swallows the new host and takes him or her to a separate, mental plane where he envelops the mind of his victim.",
      "It was developed in order to fuel his dream of acquiring all the knowledge in existence, a feat that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime.",
      "Orochimaru can only perform this technique once every three years.",
      "It also seems that when the three years are almost over, he is forced to move into another host, as the previous one begins to weaken and reject him.",
      "Presumably, if he had a proper container, he could stay in the host for a full lifetime.",
      "The fact that he wanted to prepare Sasuke Uchiha and Kimimaro for the transfer before performing it reinforces this.",
      "a gigantic white snake composed of smaller white snakes, by abandoning his current host's body.",
      "The snake body then dies and falls apart, and Orochimaru's soul dominates the body (though the Sharingan seems to be able to reverse the process against Orochimaru, which also grants the host Orochimaru's supply of chakra and powers).",
      "The souls of the hosts are kept alive within Orochimaru, leaving them \"still alive\", in a sense (albeit suppressed), and when Orochimaru switches hosts, the souls leave with him.",
      "Apparently if the host of these souls' chakra level falls enough it is possible for them to resurface in material form as seen with Orochimaru surfacing with his Eight Branches Technique after Sasuke used up most of his chakra.",
      "After taking over another body, Orochimaru modifies it to suit his theme of snakes, in order to increase his survival capabilities, such as stretching and bending his body, reconnecting any severed parts, and shedding his skin to heal injuries.",
      "This ensures that if Orochimaru cannot transfer to another body within the three years' time, he can allow his current one to greatly heal and evade attacks, rendering it virtually immortal; Sasuke refers this as the .",
      "Orochimaru also alters the face of his host to look like his original form.",
