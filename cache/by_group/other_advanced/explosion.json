This explosion is powerful enough to completely obliterate an opponent far larger than the user.\n\n## Notes\n- Due to the directionality of the blast, the user minimises any potential repercussions, such as being struck by resultant debris and even recoil appears to be completely negated.\n- In the anime, Gari also uses a less-destructive version of this technique, creating a puff of smoke instead of an explosion.\n"

By doing so the object can be shaped, animated, and controlled remotely.\n\n## Notes\n- On command, the object's size can also be manipulated â€” from nano-sized to gigantic heights.\n- Once the user infuses their chakra into an object, it can become a source of origin for a technique.\n- Deidara stole this technique in his quest to find the ultimate art and used it in conjunction with his Explosion Release kekkei genkai to infuse explosive chakra into clay, creating his signature Explosive Clay.\n- Sekiei, a fabrication, was given both the nature transformation and this technique to utilise it in the same way.\n"
