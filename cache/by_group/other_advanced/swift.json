To an observer, it appears as if the user has teleported.\n\n## Usage\n- * The Body Flicker Technique is similar to Swift Release, a kekkei genkai that allows the user to move at high speeds.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- In Viz's English translations, the Body Flicker Technique is called \"Teleportation\", whereas spaceâ€“time ninjutsu are generally referred to as \"Transportation Techniques\".\n\n## Notes\n- It is accomplished by using chakra to temporarily vitalise the body and move at extreme speeds.\n- The amount of chakra required depends on the overall distance and elevation between the user and the intended destination.\n- Despite this, the Flying Thunder God Technique is regularly mistaken for \"Body Flicker Technique\" by various individuals, including the technique's creator, due to targets not seen to be tagged for the \"Flying Thunder God Technique\".\n- ** Further confusion exists in some translations of the series.\n"
