The bullets are so fast that they are difficult to see.\n\n## Notes\n- The moment the user has finished preparing the attack, evading it becomes extremely difficult.\n- Using the repellent force of magnetism, the speed of the bullets is rapidly increased after they are shot.\n- Furthermore, the user can also use an attack pattern where the Iron Sand bullets are shaped into sharp needles, increasing their ability to wound or kill the opponent.\n- Since the Iron Sand has a magnetic force and (when used by Sasori) is also drenched in poison, defending against this technique is almost impossible.\n- This technique is especially threatening to puppet users, since the puppets can be rendered immobile if the sand gets lodged into their joints.\n"

The weight and size of these shapes are so great, they can easily shatter bedrock and break through most defences with a single hit.\n\n## Usage\n- This allows the user to create the best weapon for the fight, by taking into account the opponent's abilities and the surrounding environment.\n- |-\n|\n|\n|Besides being capable of penetrating through someone's body, these long spikes can be used to attack multiple targets.\n- |-\n|\n|\n|This giant block-like weapon can be used to crush its target with devastating power as a giant block that is used to crush the target.\n\n## Notes\n- Because the weapon is made out of Iron Sand, the shape can be whatever the user wants, and can even be changed during the fight.\n- Since the Iron Sand generates a strong magnetic field, the opponent cannot use any metal weapons or tools.\n- It can be spun to pick it up even more power, giving it a drill-like appearance.\n- It can also be shaped into a thinner, but longer version of it to increase its range.\n- The user can also hover them over their target to launch them down at any time with incredible speed.\n- |}\n\n## Trivia\n\n* When written as \"結集\", kesshū means \"concentration\" or \"regimentation\".\n"

The user first creates two masses of Iron Sand of opposing magnetic fields and then merges them together.\n\n## Notes\n- This causes the magnetic forces to instantly increase and the repellent force created by the two opposing magnetic fields scatters the Iron Sand across a vast area.\n- The Iron Sand spreads in spikes that branch off irregularly, making it almost impossible to get a clear overview of what is happening.\n- This also makes evading the spikes nearly impossible.\n- Even if the opponent has managed to evade getting hit, the Iron Sand spikes will have filled the entire surroundings, cutting off any escape routes.\n- With the opponent trapped, the user is free to attack in person.\n- Because Sasori coats his Iron Sand in his lethal poison, the technique is even deadlier; if one of the spikes so much as scratches the target, it will introduce enough poison into the target's body to kill them.\n"

However, the magnetic force weakens from object to object.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Any individual that comes into direct contact with these shuriken themselves are magnetised; as such, it is crucial that the opponent avoids all of them as even a single deflection will result in the production of a powerful magnetic field around their body.\n\n## Notes\n- Once a person has been magnetised, the user can manipulate the magnetic field in such a manner as to make any subsequent attack using a metallic weapon impossible to evade.\n- Toroi uses his Magnet Release to magnetise a large quantity of shuriken, which he then throws in the direction of his opponents.\n"

The amount of dust produced by this ability is comparable to that of the sand used during Gaara's Quicksand Waterfall Flow technique, but as gold is the heavier of the two, the former was capable of nullifying the latter when they clashed.\n"

Karura's love for Gaara was so great that, in death, her spirit possessed the sands and used them to protect him.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe.\n- It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: Karura truly did love Gaara and the Shield of Sand truly is her doing.\n- The Shield of Sand reacts to any attack against Gaara, even those Gaara himself is not aware of.\n- When he's about to be physically harmed in any way, the Shield of Sand moves between him and the threat in order to block it.\n- Though most often used in shielding Gaara from enemies, the sand also protects him from self-inflicted injury.\n- Because the shield is formed from sand that's been seeped in Gaara's chakra, it has a very fast response time, too fast for most enemies to overcome.\n- Some, such as Rock Lee and Sasuke Uchiha, are fast enough to outpace the sand, striking Gaara before it's able to shield him; it is against opponents such as these that he relies on his Armour of Sand for defence.\n- The combination of the armour and shield is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.\n- The Shield of Sand can protect Gaara against a great variety of threats, at different times defending him from kunai, taijutsu, Explosive Clay, to name only a few.\n- The sand itself is very good at absorbing the force from attacks, and so it is rarely even misshapen from the impact.\n- On those infrequent occasions when attacks do push against the shield, it places enough of a buffer between it and Gaara to stop the blow before it reaches him.\n- Even though the Shield of Sand ordinarily acts independently of Gaara, he is able to exert some control over it if he chooses.\n- He can fully surround himself with the shield, eliminating the chance of it being bypassed through sheer speed.\n- While he does this, he relies on his Third Eye to see what's going on outside, and then forms spikes from the shield to keep approaching enemies away.\n- In Gaara Hiden , Gaara uses his Magnet Release to mix \"sparkling metal particles\" into the Shield of Sand, fortifying it against attacks that would otherwise penetrate it.\n- Even Karura's will sometimes influences the Shield of Sand, shaping it into her likeness as it protects Gaara to remind him of her.\n\n## Notes\n- Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the Fourth Kazekage, tried to assassinate Gaara.\n- After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him.\n- In Part I, Gaara usually enters this sphere of sand while preparing to enter Tailed Beast Mode.\n"
