      "markdown": "# Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Element/Type: Ice Release\n- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Ice Release, Hiden~Yuki Clan, Ninjutsu\n- Class: Offensive\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Haku\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game\n\n## Summary\nThis technique is performed with the \"cursed\" kekkei genkai of the Yuki clan. Haku creates several large mirrors out of ice, which he surrounds a target with.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * The technique specific seal for this jutsu closely resembles the hand seal for the real life Kuji-in seal of Pyō (兵) which has the middle fingers hooked over the index fingers and touching, the only difference being that the remaining four fingers are curled inward with the fingernails not showing.\n\n## Notes\n- Haku's reflection will appear in all of them.\n- Haku can travel between these mirrors near-instantaneously, giving the appearance that he occupies all of them simultaneously.\n- As such, any attacks he makes from these mirrors - usually rapid volleys of thrown senbon - can overwhelm opponents, seemingly coming from every mirror at once.\n- In the anime, if the mirror the user is in is broken, they can leap out of one of the fragments and continue their attack or move to another mirror.\n- Although Haku moves between the mirrors extremely quickly, to the point that Rin no Sho describes it as light speed, Similarly, although the mirrors are quite resilient, notably not melting against standard Fire Release, Naruto's jinchūriki form is strong enough to shatter one.\n- These exceptions aside, the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals is still a formidable technique.\n- Most victims will be unable to do anything against Haku's attacks, as they are so fast and come from so many directions at once that it's impossible to see all of them.\n- If they should try to attack Haku while he's within a mirror, he can simply move to another mirror before they've even noticed.\n"

It is strong enough to withstand the air assault of many explosive tags at once, remaining almost undamaged.\n"
