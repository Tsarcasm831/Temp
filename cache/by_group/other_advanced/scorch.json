These orbs rotate around the user and can be freely controlled to attack enemies.\n\n## Usage\n- However, this technique is vulnerable to Water Release, which can be used to dissipate the heat, becoming steam.\n\n## Notes\n- When an orb touches an opponent, it instantly evaporates all the water inside their body, leaving them in a mummified state.\n- When this happens, steam can be seen emitting from the opponent's body.\n- * In later depictions in the anime, the orbs were changed into magatama.\n"
