It allows the user to put their opponent under an illusion using only words and speech.\n\n## Notes\n- By infusing chakra into the tongue of the user, any target within auditory range of the user will become easily swayed in a post-hypnotic trance of their will and self-assurance; forcing them to face their innermost trauma as realised by the user's words in an effort to mentally break their spirit.\n- Once told to look behind their back the genjutsu becomes complete, causing them to as an obedient follower of the user.\n- The illusion itself cannot be easily broken, even when the person is under realisation that the genjutsu is in effect, but strong emotional connections, like love, can help in dispelling it.\n- Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely.\n- Likewise, echoes and acoustics that enhance the user's voice can make the genjutsu more effective to sway the target.\n- * Kankurō indirectly references this from Gaara's Tale DLC in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 .\n"

It has also been shown to be performed through the Sharingan's higher evolutions: the Mangekyō Sharingan and the Rinnegan.\n\n## Usage\n- Members of the Uchiha clan are particularly famous for using their Sharingan to control the Nine-Tails, so much so that Konoha quickly came to suspect Uchiha involvement in the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack.\n- * A shadowy version of Sasuke's humanoid Susanoo first appears in a genjutsu he creates,\n* Despite genjutsu working by altering the chakra flow of a target's cerebral nervous system, this technique affected Mecha-Naruto who doesn't have a brain.\n\n## Notes\n- Sasuke Uchiha is noted to be able to use the technique through his Rinnegan, to trap all the tailed beasts in a genjutsu with a mere glance.\n- The illusions created by Genjutsu: Sharingan do not appear to have any trademark form, appearing vastly different between the same functions and even the same users.\n- For example, Sasuke typically uses it to render targets unconscious, yet on the first occasion the target's body is pierced with large feathers, on another, the target is grasped and overwhelmed by a shadowy figure, and on the third the target experiences Sasuke personally stabbing them.\n- However, this wasn't required in Sasuke's usage.\n"

The exact method of achieving this varies from user to user: in the anime Kaguya Ōtsutsuki uses Yomotsu Hirasaka to create a portal to a dimension containing a moon; Obito Uchiha produces the Ten-Tails and transforms it into a construct of the God Tree, which has a Rinne Sharingan within the blooming flower at its top; Madara Uchiha, per his Eye of the Moon Plan, flies into the sky and reflects his own Rinne Sharingan off of the moon.\n\n## Usage\n- A Rinnegan user can block the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, saving themselves and those within their range from its control.\n- * In the anime, Kankurō creates the ultimate puppet, which is a giant transforming robot.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Should these be possessed by two different people, they must form the rat hand seal together in order to release the technique.\n\n## Notes\n- Once cast, the penetrating light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi shines across the world, bright enough to dispel the night for as long as it is active.\n- All those who fall under its gaze are trapped in the genjutsu, with the Rinnegan's design appearing in their eyes to represent its influence.\n- Victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are rendered immobile so long as they are under its effects, allowing them to easily be wrapped by the bark of the God Tree's roots using God: Nativity of a World of Trees.\n- Over the course of years, humans connected to the tree in this manner are gradually drained of their life energy, personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into White Zetsu while at the same time, producing a new Chakra Fruit in the process.\n- The user can also draw upon the chakra of those bound to the tree, causing it to erupt from the ground and enter their own body.\n- In the anime, the technique seemed to need perfecting as Kaguya discovered in her first usage: most of those trapped in Infinite Tsukuyomi such as Haori died after being trapped in the genjutsu instead of being converted into White Zetsu.\n- Certain individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- The dead, such as those brought back with the Impure World Reincarnation, are impervious to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- White Zetsu, Black Zetsu, and those whose body Black Zetsu coats are also unaffected.\n- In fact, Rinnegan users, through the combination with the chakra of the nine tailed beasts, are the only ones capable of ending the Infinite Tsukuyomi and releasing those trapped within its dreams.\n- Only a select few of these dreams have been seen:\n* Hinata Hyūga is in a strong and happy relationship with Naruto Uzumaki.\n- Neji Hyūga is also alive and watching her from afar with Hanabi Hyūga.\n- * Kiba Inuzuka is a Hokage, a position he uses to declare a national holiday for dogs.\n- Also, in the anime, all citizens of the village are to have a dog as a pet/partner.\n- * Shino Aburame discovers and tames a giant new insect species to ride.\n- * Chōji Akimichi has a wife who feeds him and loves him for his appetite.\n- Chōza Akimichi is proud of his son.\n- * Shikamaru Nara decides to never get married to which Temari agrees.\n- Asuma Sarutobi and Shikaku Nara are also alive and enjoying their respective families.\n- * Ino Yamanaka is loved by Sasuke Uchiha and Sai who fight for her affection.\n- Inoichi Yamanaka is alive and proud of his daughter.\n- * Rock Lee wins the love of Sakura Haruno by defeating Naruto and Neji in a fight.\n- * Tenten is a member of a complete and mature Team Guy.\n- In the anime, everyone she knows have polar-opposite personalities and she is a famed weapons master.\n- Furthermore, as Tenten had made direct contact with the Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths just before being caught, she retained her memories of the war and was fully aware that she was inside a dream world.\n- * Mei Terumī gets married, with the other Kage attending the ceremony.\n- In the anime, Chōjūrō and Ao attend her marriage.\n- * Tsunade lives in a Konoha where none of her loved ones died and none of her friends turned against the village while Dan became the Hokage.\n- Furthermore, in the anime, Konoha's peace and prosperity prompts Jiraiya to write a book about it.\n- * Gaara has a happy childhood with his parents, siblings, and uncle and he gets to play with Naruto whenever he wants.\n- * In the anime, Yamato becomes the official leader of Team 7 (which includes Sasuke) and is respected throughout Konoha.\n- * In the anime, Killer B goes on an adventure with his fellow jinchūriki and their tailed beasts, saving a princess from Akatsuki.\n- * In the anime, Karin gets revenge on Zōsui and has Sasuke, who is the Hokage, smile kindly at her again.\n- * In the anime, Sai learns to properly express himself again and the entire village comes to admire his smile.\n- * In the anime, Temari is respected by her siblings so much, they constantly ask for her advice.\n- * Black Zetsu revised the Stone Tablet to state that the Infinite Tsukuyomi is the salvation for the Uchiha Clan and the key to world peace, something Madara believed in.\n- * Sasuke referred to this technique as a genjutsu cast by the Rinnegan.\n- In the anime, Black Zetsu also connects the technique to the Rinnegan.\n- * In Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie , Obito casts a on Naruto and Sakura, sending them to a Genjutsu World housed within a crystal ball.\n- As Akatsuki only has seven tailed beasts at the time, the Rinne Sharingan used has only seven tomoe.\n- * Hagoromo believed that in the past, Kaguya had utilised her Byakugan in some fashion when casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi.\n- * In the anime, decades later, Boro would use tales of Infinite Tsukuyomi to persuade many people into joining his cult.\n"

See talkpage for more info. -->\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Game\n\n## Summary\nIzanagi is a genjutsu performed with the Sharingan. In the anime, users are shown extending Izanagi's influence beyond their personal reality, affecting their surroundings and those within it.\n\n## Usage\n- In exchange for the brief control over reality that Izanagi grants them, the Sharingan that they perform it with becomes blind; Because the Uchiha prized their Sharingan, to lose it in this way prompted them to label it kinjutsu.\n- Obito Uchiha, because he has control over the Senju cells he uses, is able to keep a single Izanagi active for significantly longer than Danzō.\n- * In the Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm series, Danzō uses this as part of his ultimate technique, letting his Wood Release go out of control, creating a tree that crushes both himself and the opponent, and activating Izanagi at the last moment to escape unharmed.\n\n## Notes\n- Izanagi is based on the Creation of All Things Technique, used by the Sage of Six Paths to turn imagination into reality.\n- The process is explained to use spiritual energy – which forms the basis of Yin Release – to create shape from nothingness.\n- Then, through the application of physical energy – which forms the basis of Yang Release – the shape has life breathed into it.\n- Members of the Uchiha clan, as descendants of the Sage, perform Izanagi with their Sharingan.\n- Because Uchiha only possess half of the Sage's chakra, they can only keep Izanagi active for a few seconds; allowing him to use Izanagi for one minute.\n- As this is still not very long, he has ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm, giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi with breaks in between as he chooses.\n- Since he is not an Uchiha, each use of Izanagi causes Danzō's chakra to drop significantly.\n- As with other Sharingan-based techniques, Izanagi can be programmed to activate under certain conditions.\n- Madara Uchiha did so to undo his death after he'd been entombed, restoring him to life unbeknownst to anyone.\n- In this case, it is Izanagi, who, together with his sister and wife Izanami, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\n- One of the most famous stories about Izanagi tells the tale of how he goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve Izanami after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, Kagutsuchi.\n- In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape.\n- Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form.\n- Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave.\n- Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day.\n- In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day.\n- In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\n- After his failed attempt to get Izanami, he washed himself in a stream.\n- As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n- Like Izanagi, Izanami also blinds the Sharingan that it is performed with.\n- * During initial depictions of Izanagi, the blindness it causes is represented by the eye's lids closing.\n- After the blindness caused by Izanami is depicted as turning the eye a blank white, Izanagi starts being depicted the same way.\n- * Despite Madara using a time-activated Izanagi in the manga, he is not listed as a user of Izanagi in Jin no Sho .\n"

Like its counterpart, in exchange for the temporary ability that it grants the user, the Sharingan with which Izanami is cast is rendered blind and loses its light forever.\n\n## Usage\n- In the anime, it's shown that there is no other way to undo this technique even by someone who has complete control over their chakra.\n\n## Notes\n- According to Itachi, this technique and Izanagi form a pair, but unlike the latter, which is a technique capable of altering destiny, Izanami is instead one that \" decides \" it.\n- The user must then intentionally replicate the same sensation and in the same way, memorise that instant with their Sharingan (represented as: A ).\n- Izanami overlaps and connects these two identical bodily sensations (A and A'), as well as the flow of time between them, creating an infinite loop of events that entraps the opponent's consciousness.\n- The user can also use their Sharingan to remember multiple sensations, (represented as B, C, and so forth) and those sensations will also be used when Izanami is activated.\n- The user also doesn't need necessarily to replicate A with A' to initiate Izanami.\n- They can also replicate B with B' or C with C' as well.\n- The more sensations they memorise, the better their chances would be to initiate Izanami on a person and the more sensations the victim will experience each time they repeat a loop.\n- Each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage incurred is reset as it were before the start of the loop, although the remains of severed appendages do not disappear.\n- The illusion of the user and anyone they were fighting alongside also have any damage reset as well such as the blindness that comes with Izanami.\n- Despite being able to become consciously aware of their situation and act differently, the victim is unable to significantly alter or escape from the inevitable progression of these events as the illusions they're fighting will also quickly adapt to their changes in order to force the victim to experience the memorised sensations.\n- However, because this technique was created to reprimand and save the users of Izanagi, the victim is able to escape the infinite loop if they can acknowledge the real results of their actions and in doing so, accept their fate.\n- The illusion of the caster also seems to be sentient as the illusionary Itachi was shown to be shaking his head when Kabuto futilely tried to undo the technique without accepting his fate first.\n- The illusion of the user and anyone they're fighting alongside also repeats their verbal actions such as the illusionary Itachi telling the illusionary Sasuke not to leave his side, an action Itachi did to Sasuke.\n- The illusion of the user will continuously tell the victim to take a closer look at them and acknowledge their mistakes until they do so.\n- Whilst this resulted in little issue if only one person were using Izanagi, if there were two or more casters, they would begin to fight amongst each other over personally favourable outcomes.\n- Thus, as dōjutsu users were unlikely to succumb to ocular genjutsu, Izanami was created as a method to reprimand such clansmen, as well as save them from their own arrogance.\n- By imprisoning them within an unalterable loop of events, the victim was forced to accept the reality they had created if they ever wished to escape the illusion.\n- However, because of the dangers involved in using a technique with a built-in escape route in a real battle, Izanami became classed as a kinjutsu.\n- As such, Izanami is ironically not a genjutsu to be used on an enemy, but on a friend who has lost their way as a means of helping them find themselves again.\n- In this case, it is Izanami, who, together with her brother and husband Izanagi, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\n- One of the most famous stories about Izanami tells the tale of how Izanagi goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve her after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, Kagutsuchi.\n- In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape.\n- Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form.\n- Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave.\n- Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day.\n- In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day.\n- In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\n- After his failed attempt to get Izanami, Izanagi washed himself in a stream.\n- As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n"

As a testament to its power, it was strong enough to negate Kabuto Yakushi's control over a reincarnated Itachi Uchiha, despite the former's binding being considered near-absolute.\n\n## Usage\n- * During the Five Kage Summit, the Fifth Mizukage commented that she could not help but conclude that there was a connection between this technique and the power that controlled Yagura Karatachi, the Fourth Mizukage.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The technique was instead used on Itachi himself, after being reincarnated and inadvertently using his Mangekyō Sharingan when encountering Naruto during the Fourth Shinobi World War.\n\n## Notes\n- After having the crow cast the technique, Itachi noted that the dōjutsu required at least a decade before it could be used again.\n- This period can be drastically reduced through the possession of Hashirama Senju's chakra, even for a non-Uchiha transplantee, as observed by Danzō Shimura's use.\n- Noted as Shisui Uchiha's ultimate technique, it was highly coveted by Danzō, who later stole Shisui's right eye and had it implanted into his own right eye-socket to gain access to this dōjutsu.\n- Later, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi Uchiha, who implanted it into the eye-socket of one of his crows.\n- This crow was later forcibly stored inside Naruto Uzumaki and rigged to emerge only in response to confronting Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan.\n- Upon activation, Itachi rigged the eye itself so that the genjutsu would give the order \" protect Konoha \" to whoever was affected by it.\n- Itachi intended this to be used on his brother, in the eventuality that he turned against the village and assumed that he would have transplanted his eyes in order to obtain an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan by then.\n- When the Heavens and Earth were created, three of these gods came down from the as so-called : gods that did not appear as a husband-wife duo.\n- These three gods are called the and were:\n# , the supreme god.\n- # , the god of conquest and rule.\n- # , the god of birth.\n- After them, when the land was formed and sea was rising to the surface, two more gods appeared:\n#\n#\n\nThese five gods have a special place among the , hence their name: .\n- After them came the , the last of which were Izanagi and Izanami, who were responsible for creating the Japanese archipelago.\n"

      "markdown": "# Labyrinth Genjutsu\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Element/Type: Yin Release\n- Classification: Genjutsu, Scientific Ninja Tool Techniques\n- Class: Supplementary\n- Users: Ōga\n- Media: Anime\n\n## Summary\nThis is a genjutsu used by Ōga, placing her victims in labyrinth like simulations with puzzles to solve for her experiments, with the assistance of the technology provided by Kara. Ōga can use the genjutsu anyway she sees fit, creating multiple rooms and landscapes, even those that exist in the real world, such as Kara's hideout, with traps and hazards.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- The objective is to find hidden hiding spots for the subjects to hide in to avoid being crushed.\n\n## Notes\n- She can operate as two individuals within the genjutsu; as an older man who guides them through the experiments she had conceived and as a kunoichi named Yatsume that is also one of the subjects to further study the others.\n- Those who die within the genjutsu do not die in the real world, but they remain stasis in tanks until the genjutsu ends.\n- There are two ways of ending the genjutsu: the captives must kill Ōga within it or the Illusion scroll that is keeping the genjutsu active must be removed.\n- Should the former be chosen, Ōga would become comatose in the real world.\n- The following various genjutsu experiments test the subjects ability to survive.\n- ;Nine Lives\n\nBefore the first experiment, Ōga provided a test for any one of the subjects to participate.\n- She had ten cards, nine are \"death\" while one was \"life\", and if the participant picks the \"life\" card, they live.\n- A Kirigakure shinobi participated in this test, randomly picking a \"death\" card which resulted in him being killed by Ōga.\n- ;Collapse\n\nFor the first experiment, Ōga placed the now twenty subjects on a crumbling platform in the middle of an abyss.\n- The subjects are to reach a higher platform in order to survive.\n- With the help of Kiseru, those who were not shinobi were able to reach it with ladders placed on the top.\n- {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n!\n- Subjects !!\n- Outcome\n|-\n| Anaguma || Dropped to his death by Rokuro\n|-\n| Batta || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Boruto Uzumaki || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Fugō || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Kakesu || Dropped to her death\n|-\n| Kiseru Gankubi || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Namua || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Rokuro || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Shamo || Proceeded to the next experiment\n|-\n| Unnamed Kusagakure shinobi || Proceeded;

It is accurate enough to even make the tentacles go through tiny holes.\n\n## Usage\n- Basically, this technique takes the user's own shadow and transforms and stretches it into countless thin tentacles, which are then used to grab objects and pull them in.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- There are no hand seals used for this technique, but the hand movements resemble that of Gaara's Sand Binding Coffin.\n\n## Notes\n- Also, one can skilfully make use of the tentacle-shaped shadow tendrils by using them to lift up and throw weapons like kunai and such.\n- This technique has many possible applications and uses.\n- That is, the final moves in strategy games like chess, shōgi, or Go.\n- This translation is almost as perfect as gathering in this case, since this technique was the final move in Shikamaru's shōgi-themed mission.\n- * In Naruto: The Broken Bond , Shikamaru used this technique in Part I.\n- * Shikamaru was shown training Shikadai in the basics of this technique.\n"

The Nara attaches their shadow to a \"host's\" own without restricting their movements, or forcing them to mimic their own movement.\n\n## Usage\n- This allows the host to move freely all the while the Nara's shadow is still attached to their own.\n- This technique allows for the Nara to bind multiple targets on a battlefield all while not directly engaging in combat, adding an element of surprise to their companion's attacks.\n\n## Notes\n- Through the shadow, the Nara is able to sense when their combined shadow comes into contact with the target's, basically using the latter's own shadow as an intermediary to link up other shadows in proximity, and they can then bind them with the Shadow Imitation Technique.\n"

By using these weapons to pierce the enemies' shadows, they are paralysed in place.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- To pierce the shadow, it is necessary to avoid the target just barely — Shikamaru added fake explosive tags when he used them against Kakuzu and Hidan to help with that.\n\n## Notes\n- Since it is more difficult for the enemy to notice it, this ninjutsu compensates for the weak point of the similar Shadow Imitation Technique, being its limited effective range.\n- It is unknown for how long this jutsu can keep its targets paralysed, however it can be disrupted simply by the removal of the blade or by the disappearance of the opponent's shadow.\n"

The user can stretch their shadow however they wish in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area; if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it.\n\n## Usage\n- Although most often used against opponents, the Shadow Imitation Technique can be used to save allies, freezing them in physically impossible positions so that they won't trigger booby traps or causing them to cling to sheer surfaces with no means of support.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- If a target is strong enough or if the user is weakened enough, targets can resist and even overpower the Shadow Imitation's control.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Keeping a target restrained requires a great deal of chakra, making it difficult to maintain the Shadow Imitation for long periods of time; in Part II, Shikamaru can only maintain it for five minute intervals.\n\n## Notes\n- But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range; Shikamaru Nara frequently uses flash bombs, either to briefly extend his own shadow or to extend his targets'.\n- Shikamaru Hiden clarifies that a user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in utter darkness.\n- Once a user merges their shadow with a target's, the target cannot move on their own other than to talk.\n- The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand.\n- Nara tend to wear their shuriken holsters in atypical locations so that, when they reach for and throw shuriken, their targets will reach for and throw nothing.\n- At times, the Shadow Imitation's mimicry is two-way, as if a third-party forces the target to make a move, the user will be forced to make the same move.\n- With repeated use or against multiple targets, the duration of the binding becomes shorter.\n- When that happens, Nara will inevitably use one of their other techniques, such as the Shadow–Neck Binding Technique or Shadow Sewing Technique.\n- The Shadow Imitation Technique was previously known as the , which was only capable of restricting targets' movements.\n- The imitation aspect was apparently not added until after Orochimaru defected from Konohagakure, as his Otogakure invaders did not know about it prior to the Konoha Crush.\n- Shikaku Nara still uses the old name sometimes.\n- * In the English dub of the anime, Sakon states that he mastered this technique.\n- * In the anime, Inojin Yamanaka tricked Metal Lee into believing that his ink snakes were this technique.\n- * In the Naruto: Clash of Ninja series, Kakashi can perform this technique by copying it with his Sharingan.\n- * In Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 , using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name \"Eight Way Shadow Imitation Technique\".\n"

There, the shadow can be used for restraint, replacing or adding to the binding of the Shadow Imitation; the closer the user is to their target, the stronger this binding becomes.\n\n## Usage\n- For this reason, it is most effective when immediately used to strangle a target, hence the name.\n- In The Last: Naruto the Movie , Shikamaru Nara uses the Shadow–Neck Binding to control the Ōtsutsuki clan's puppet, forcing them to fight among themselves.\n\n## Notes\n- Like the Shadow Imitation, the Shadow–Neck Binding requires a great deal of chakra to maintain, making it weaker over extended periods of time.\n- * In the anime, it was shown that this technique can be manipulated in a similar manner to the Shadow Sewing Technique.\n- * The technique appears in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm as Shikamaru's ultimate technique.\n- However, rather than strangling the opponent, it binds them to a nearby rock and then tightly squeezes them, destroying the rock and crushing the opponent.\n- * In Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 , using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name \"Shadow Sinking Technique\".\n"

The user changes the shape of their shadow into several sharp tendril-like needles and controls each separately.\n\n## Usage\n- This technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Shikamaru uses the special seal used in the Multi-Size Technique instead of the Bird seal, as the ring and little fingers were raised in the manga , but the index finger is raised instead of the ring finger in the movie.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.\n\n## Notes\n- They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads.\n- This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support.\n- After this technique hits someone, it can then be directly transformed back into the Shadow Imitation Technique; conversely, after immobilising the target(s) with the latter technique, a proficient user can then also transition so into the Shadow Sewing Technique to thereby subsequently inflict harm to the captured party.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5 , Shikamaru throws several explosive tags up in the air and uses this technique to pin them on his opponent.\n- The folded fingers are also interlocked in the manga, but not in the movie.\n"

It is represented by a dark-coloured, crescent moon-like on the user's left hand.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- When the Yin and Yang powers are used together, they can seal and transform their target into the core of the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei technique.\n- When Sasuke did so in conjunction with Naruto Uzumaki's Six Paths Yang Power, the palm seal on his left hand vanished, returning to Hagoromo's own left hand.\n\n## Notes\n- It can be presumed that it augments the user's abilities.\n- As noted by Black Zetsu, there is a special resonance between the Six Paths Yin and Yang powers, allowing the wielders to sense each other's presence.\n"

Said to represent the , it is the antipode to Amaterasu.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Because of the power of the Mangekyō Sharingan and the speed with which Tsukuyomi works, normal methods of countering genjutsu are ineffective against it.\n- Sharingan users can briefly resist unconsciousness, In Akatsuki Hiden , Itachi theorises that love can be used to revive victims, his reasoning being that, since Tsukuyomi destroys the spirit, feelings that reconnect the spirit can undo Tsukuyomi; Kodaka does indeed do this in order to resuscitate his younger brother, Kiiro.\n\n## Notes\n- he uses Tsukuyomi to subject victims to days' worth of torture in a matter of seconds; examples include continual stabbing or reliving traumatic events over and over.\n- Tsukuyomi's illusions are usually represented as an inverted grey scale; in the anime, there is usually also a red moon in a red sky.\n- Using Tsukuyomi requires a great deal of chakra, making it inadvisable for Itachi to continue fighting after using it.\n- However, victims of Tsukuyomi have it far worse, as they are ordinarily rendered comatose as soon as Tsukuyomi's illusion is completed.\n- According to Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night , \"the time that passed within this genjutsu was one one-hundredth of one one-thousandth of one one-millionth of that of the real world.\" In the novel, Itachi uses Tsukuyomi on Izumi Uchiha, causing her to live through decades of a happy life in the span of a few moments.\n- When she dies of old age within the illusion, her actual body dies as well.\n- He is one of the \"three noble children\" (alongside the sun goddess Amaterasu and the sea and storm god Susanoo) born when Izanagi cleansed himself of defilement after escaping from the underworld, with Tsukuyomi born when Izanagi washed out his right eye.\n- According to the Nihon Shoki , Amaterasu's wrath over Tsukuyomi's killing of the goddess of food led to the sun goddess refusing to ever look at Tsukuyomi's face again, forever moving to another part of the sky while Tsukuyomi's fear of his sister's wrath makes him hide during the day (hence explaining why day and night are separate).\n- According to some modern interpretations, Tsukuyomi is thought of as a god of time, or at least of the calendar; the basis for this is the interpretation of \"moon reading\" as reading the movements of the moon, an act paired with reading the calender(=day), and the verb being used in the Man'yōshū and other books to refer to counting the days of the month.\n- This connection may be referenced by Itachi's ability to manipulate a victim's sense of time within Tsukuyomi's dreamscape.\n- It's unclear if the genjutsu he ends up using is in fact Tsukuyomi, as such a form of information-gathering is usually done with Genjutsu: Sharingan.\n- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm , Itachi uses Tsukuyomi by having the red moon crush the opponent while the image of the moon warps into a copy of his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n"
