    "summary": "The Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation is a jutsu that binds the soul of a deceased person to a living vessel, restoring them as they were in the last moments of their lives in order to do their summoner's bidding. It was originally created by Tobirama Senju, some time after which he declared it a kinjutsu.",
    "technique": [
      "In general, this limited control is not an issue for the summoner, and they will typically \"deactivate\" the reincarnation, placing them in a coffin for storage and transportation until they're needed.",
      "In order to actually be able to control their actions, the user must implant a special talisman - generally attached to the end of a kunai - within the reincarnation's brain.",
      "At its most basic, the reincarnated souls retain their personality, giving them the freedom to approach a given task however they like so long as it broadly carries out the summoner's bidding.",
      "The summoner instead controls all of their actions, even permitting them to speak through the reincarnation or summon other reincarnated souls to their location.",
      "Orochimaru prefers this level of control.",
      "Kabuto has at times rewritten talismans remotely in order switch to this level of control when the situation calls for it.",
      "If the summoner chooses to, they can rejuvenate the reincarnation while planting their control talisman, restoring their complexion and reducing some of the imperfections; this is merely aesthetic and the signs of decay do not inhibit their abilities.",
      "Reincarnated members of Akatsuki are, however, outfitted with different cloaks than they used to wear.",
      "Yin–Yang Release, as manifested in Truth-Seeking Balls, can negate the regenerative properties of reincarnated bodies, reducing their effectiveness and, if used to strike a vital spot, kill them for all intents and purposes.",
      "Kabuto can regain control of Itachi by gaining access to the control talisman, and in fact is still able to release him from the Impure World Reincarnation.",
      "This grants them full control of their own actions, all the benefits of an immortal body, and prevents the summoner from releasing them from the Impure World Reincarnation.",
      "Another way to take over the control of reincarnated bodies is through the usage of the Six Paths Technique, as in the case of Obito's Six Paths jinchūriki.",
      "Because of Obito's Black Receivers being embedded into the left side of each jinchūriki's chests, he was able to wrest Kabuto's control over the revived jinchūriki, and thus control the revived jinchūriki's near-perfectly.",

      "Orochimaru would discover the technique decades later and improve on its use, while his subordinate Kabuto Yakushi nearly perfected it.",
      "Kabuto remarks that this basically amounts to grave-robbing, although blood stains or organs salvaged after the target's death also work.",
      "A living sacrifice is also required for the reincarnated soul to use as a vessel.",
      "If the souls are readily available in the Impure World, such as was the case with the first four Hokage who were freshly freed from the Shinigami's stomach, they can be reincarnated through this technique.",
      "Reincarnations can be recalled in a similar way, with a coffin emerging around them to take them back.",
      "After first performing it the user is only able to restrict their movements.",
      "On the one hand, this makes them more useful in combat because they know how best to use their own abilities and, if deployed against somebody they knew when they were alive, there is a possibility for psychological warfare.",
      "On the other hand, although they are compelled to do as their summoner wishes and act without reluctance, they can undermine their summoner to a degree, either by making poor decisions that opponents can take advantage of or by giving opponents advice about how to defeat them.",
      "At its strongest level, the reincarnated soul's personality is entirely eliminated.",
      "Although this guarantees the reincarnated soul will only ever act as desired, they are less resourceful and it requires the summoner's attention for every action that must be taken, making it difficult for them to multi-task depending on the circumstances.",
      "A reincarnated individual will have all the abilities they had during their life, including kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.",
      "They are physically restored as they were at the time of their death, including any physical handicaps they may have possessed, such as Nagato's damaged legs.",
      "illnesses they had will not be preserved, nor will any physical damage that contributed to their death.",
      "There is some inconsistency of whether or not foreign body matter will be restored as well: Hanzō retains the poison gland of the black salamander, but Madara Uchiha does not have access to Hashirama Senju's genetic material and thus Kabuto must artificially reproduce it for him.",
      "Clothing is reproduced according to what they wore when they died, although it is merely a superficial aspect of their reincarnated body; armour offers no actual protection, being of the same ashen material as the rest of their body.",
      "Weaponry is usually not retained and must instead be gathered by the summoner; the reincarnated Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist only have access to those swords Kabuto is able to acquire.",
      "One exception seems to be the Gold and Silver Brothers' Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths, which are still seemingly stored within the brothers' bodies.",
      "The vast majority of the reincarnated were able to achieve the same power they had at life, such as Mū.",
      "But a few of the reincarnated, such as Madara Uchiha’s full abilities were limited by the technique.",
      "For example, even with the perfected Impure World Reincarnation; Madara's reincarnated body is successfully bound by the Sage Art: Gate of the Great God, which he easily breaks free of as soon as he is restored to life.",
      "Likewise, there are some things a reincarnated body simply cannot do, such as access all the abilities of the Rinnegan or become the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.",
      "Any damage they receive will regenerate in time and, assuming the damage is not too debilitating, they can continue attacking even before their body recovers.",
      "This was one of the main purposes Tobirama created the technique for, as he would use one or more reincarnated souls to perform a series of Kamikaze-like attacks until the opposition was wiped out; he created the Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags specifically for this purpose.",
      "A second benefit is the limitless refilling of their diminished chakra reserves that the reincarnated individuals have access to; they can fight eternally and perform ordinarily physically demanding or chakra-intensive jutsu without issue, knowing their current reserves will infinitely refill.",
      "or only being able to create a certain number of clones.",
      "The reincarnated body can be further enhanced to \"beyond their prime\".",
      "When Madara Uchiha was brought back, Kabuto put his body through a selective evolution, combing the best attributes from different points of his life.",
      "In addition to his body being restored to its physical prime rather than the withered state it had when he died, he also retained the various abilities he gained only during the last years of his natural life; he retained the graft of Hashirama Senju's DNA so he could still access the First Hokage's abilities, and he has access to dōjutsu he gave up during his life.",
      "Reincarnated individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.",
      "When a soul is released from the Impure World Reincarnation, their body disintegrates back into dust and the sacrifice's corpse will be left lying in the debris.",
      "The soul may linger briefly - with their personality restored if it was being suppressed - to leave parting words or take final actions.",
      "Souls released by their summoner will be enveloped in light throughout the process.",
      "Even if the Impure World Reincarnation cannot be broken conventionally, reincarnated bodies can still be neutralised.",
      "The spirits of those reincarnated by the technique will remain damaged even if the jutsu is released, as shown with Minato Namikaze.",
      "There are also other instances of a reincarnated body escaping their summoner's influence.",
      "Itachi Uchiha was targeted with Kotoamatsukami by Shisui's eye transplanted into a crow which was stored in Naruto, displacing Kabuto's commands with different orders.",
      "However, it should be noted that Kabuto is still able to release them from the Impure World Reincarnation.",
