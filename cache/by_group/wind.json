Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\n\n## Usage\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- The second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.\n- With the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.\n- * Despite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.\n\n## Notes\n- The first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust.\n- Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills.\n- Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\n"

It uses chakra to infuse with and condense a mass amount of wind-chakra to form a massive demonic-like claw extending from the user's hand to strike and grab a target, as well as deflect any weapon or attack.\n\n## Notes\n- Depending on its use, the user can manipulate the size and length of the claw to attack and defend at any range.\n- In addition to making it a deadly weapon, the extending claw also carries tremendous force that can devastate anything in its path without affecting the user, making it useful for dislodging solid and heavy objects.\n"

The sphere in the technique's centre is considerably larger compared to that of the Rasenshuriken's standard variant.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- When thrown it causes a tremendous wind sphere upon detonation that can be seen from several kilometres away, and is enough to even neutralise a reincarnated Madara Uchiha long enough to be restrained, while simultaneously destroying both of Hashirama's wood dragons.\n\n## Notes\n- The user can also keep adding chakra to the technique causing it to expand to enormous proportions.\n- In this enormous version, Rasenshuriken shines very brightly in the dark.\n"

Naruto and eight of his shadow clones each form a Rasenshuriken that's been imbued with the unique chakra of a different tailed beast; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra Kaguya Ōtsutsuki would be weak to.\n\n## Notes\n- Jin no Sho describes this as, \"the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time.\"\n\nThe exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:\n#The Rasenshuriken for Shukaku has a similar appearance to the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan, which uses magnetized sand.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Matatabi appears to consist of the same blue fire that Matatabi's body is composed of.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Isobu is seemingly formed out of water.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Son Gokū appears to be the Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Kokuō seems to be emitting steam, which Kokuō's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Saiken resembles a bubbly gas.\n- In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for Wisdom Wolf Decay.\n- In the anime, it appears more analogous to the Soap Bubble Ninjutsu used by Saiken's jinchūriki.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Chōmei has no obvious source in either the manga or anime.\n- Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 identifies it as being composed of Scale Powder.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Gyūki is seemingly made of ink, which Gyūki's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.\n- #The Rasenshuriken for Kurama appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , both known variations of the Lava Release are implied to be present separately within this technique.\n"

Because the wind to flame ratio is perfectly balanced, the flames are greatly enhanced, causing whatever is struck by this technique to be enveloped in a swirling mass of black flames.\n\n## Notes\n- A smaller-scale version of this technique combined a normal Rasenshuriken and black flames manipulated with Kagutsuchi to form a flaming pinwheel.\n- When the technique made contact with the target, they were launched backwards and likewise engulfed in the black flames.\n- * The fact that this technique is referred to as Scorch Release is not because it is a kekkei genkai, but presumably because the basic elements fire and wind make up the actual advanced nature transformation of Scorch Release.\n- * Referring to the original use of this technique, Tobirama Senju noted that he had never seen such a Kagutsuchi before, and that this technique had the same chakra ratio from both its parent techniques, which he noted was something tough to achieve, even for an experienced duo.\n- * Unlike the Rasenshuriken, the small-scale version of this technique doesn't cause cellular damage to either user's arms.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , the jutsu works differently when used in story mode, circling around the Ten-Tails, creating a vortex around it.\n- It also maintained the countless small attacks of the wind chakra.\n- Naruto and Sasuke are also able to use it when in a combined awakening, in this case, the jutsu is called \"Blaze Release: Rasenshuriken\".\n"

Though only the size of a fist, each hides within it the power to obliterate an entire forest.\n\n## Usage\n- Acquisition method may determine the number, as both Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha gained ten orbs upon becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki; Obito initially only formed two, obtaining the other eight upon gaining control of the Ten-Tails' power.\n- In Naruto's case, the orbs currently under his control disappear and reappear alongside his chakra cloak, while the orbs he has discarded remain active.\n- However, the orbs are incapable of nullifying senjutsu, as according to Naruto, natural energy can be used to combat itself.\n- Whatever their shape, users can only control the orbs within 70 metres of their location, allowing opponents to disable them by transporting them elsewhere.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- Obito was able to manifest a single Truth-Seeking Ball after absorbing some of Madara's power.\n- Obito on defensive.png|The Sword of Nunoboko (left hand) and a shield (right hand).\n- Madara Jinchuriki anime.png|Madara's shakujō.\n\n## Notes\n- whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo.\n- Entering Tenseigan Chakra Mode also grants the user Truth-Seeking Balls.\n- The number of Truth-Seeking Balls acquired varies from user to user.\n- Upon receiving power from Hagoromo, Naruto Uzumaki, instead gained nine orbs, while Asura Ōtsutsuki only showed five orbs, nine orbs in the anime.\n- Toneri Ōtsutsuki is depicted with an inconsistent amount.\n- and users cannot create additional orbs after the initial acquisition number; thus, orbs that are lost for whatever reason cannot be replaced.\n- Clones are not created with orbs of their own, though the user can temporarily transfer them to a clone.\n- Truth-Seeking Balls encompass the power of all five basic natures, and as such they surpass both kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.\n- If imbued with a certain Yin–Yang Release jutsu, the orbs can nullify any ninjutsu they touch and thus become impervious to it; this includes negating the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation, making it possible to permanently damage and kill those reincarnated by the technique.\n- Naruto can use Truth-Seeking Balls to create his Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.\n- Similarly, Obito was able to convert one of his orbs into black receivers, allowing him to use the Six Red Yang Formation.\n- While in their default sphere form, the orbs can be launched as high-speed projectiles, expanded to enormous sizes in an instant.\n- Because the high-density chakra is in a condensed state, it can be pulled and stretched into a smooth and flat consistency, as well as freely manipulated into any other shape.\n- though Obito does so by passing them through holes that temporarily form in his hands.\n- Though highly durable, this defence can still be broken by attacks that cannot be nullified, such as powerful senjutsu and taijutsu.\n- Gudōdama 1.png|Stretched around the user as a defence.\n- Gudōdama 2.png|A weapon with adjustable length and thickness, called a in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing .\n- Obito generates Receiver.png|Converted into black receivers.\n- Obito stops Naruto and Sasuke.png|Used similar to chakra arms.\n- Truth-Seeking Orb Platform.png|Reshaped to serve as a platform.\n- Obito Second Transformation.png|Obito's shakujō.\n- NTCM and SPSM.png|Naruto's .\n- Rather than simple black constructs, Toneri demonstrated the ability to transform one of these glowing orbs into an ornate golden cage.\n- He could also combine them to create a massive vortex capable of blasting through the moon's surface and a giant sword capable of cutting the entire moon in half.\n- * Despite stating that the orbs are wielded by Six Paths Senjutsu users, the fourth databook does not classify this technique as senjutsu.\n- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and Jump Force , Truth-Seeking Balls give off a purple glow.\n- In the former, Obito employs the orbs in several unique ways, such as forming scythes, drills, spinning disks, hands capable of firing Tailed Beast Balls and blasts of chakra.\n- * Despite repeatedly accessing his orbs every time he entered Six Paths Sage Mode during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has not been seen accessing them since whenever using said form.\n- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , Obito has a technique called , in which he combines his Truth-Seeking Balls into a single expanding orb that obliterates the surrounding area.\n- The technique refers to the Trailokya, the three realms of karmic rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.\n"

Once invoked, a strong wind whirls around inside the highly concentrated mist, turning it into a solid barrier.\n\n## Usage\n- Of course, the mist can be used as a smokescreen when escaping, but the confusion it creates can also be used, for instance, to launch a surprise attack.\n\n## Notes\n- The mist created by the violent rotation of the Rasengan also has the effect of taking away the enemy's field of vision.\n- If one can use multiple natures, it is possible to perform this technique alone.\n"

      "markdown": "# Wind Release: Rasenshuriken\n\n## Quick Facts\n- Element/Type: Wind Release\n- Classification: Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu\n- Class: Offensive\n- Range: Short, Mid, Long\n- Users: Naruto Uzumaki\n- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie\n\n## Summary\nThe Wind Release: Rasenshuriken is a shuriken-shaped variant of the Wind Release: Rasengan. Like that technique, Naruto typically has the help of two shadow clones in the Rasenshuriken's formation: he provides the chakra, one clone helps keep the chakra contained, and the second clone adds his wind nature.\n\n## Counters / Defenses\n- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Hiruko tries to absorb this technique, but was unable to combine the peak-levels of shape and nature transformation, like Naruto did at first.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- Its four points are very sharp, enough to cut through rock and disintegrate most of Pain's Human Path.\n- It, however, poses enough risk for Tsunade to demand it never be used again.\n\n## Notes\n- It is the completed version of the Wind Release: Rasengan, with four large points around the central Rasengan core, giving the appearance of a fūma shuriken.\n- It also gives off a loud screeching noise.\n- By the time of The Last: Naruto the Movie , Naruto is able to create Rasenshuriken without aid and is able to remotely guide it.\n- The Rasenshuriken requires a great deal of chakra to perform.\n- Naruto has been shown creating as many as three Rasenshuriken on his own before tiring out.\n- While in Sage Mode, he can create two Rasenshuriken per transformation.\n- After the second, he must re-enter Sage Mode in order to be able to create additional Rasenshuriken.\n- However, after improving his Sage Mode he's able to use three at a single time (five in the anime), and while in his Kurama Mode or Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he can use the Rasenshuriken an unlimited number of times.\n- The technique is extremely heavy, as Fukasaku was surprised Naruto could throw the highly dense chakra, even in Sage Mode.\n- After travelling a certain distance or colliding with a target that it can't slice through, the central sphere of the Rasenshuriken detonates, producing a vortex of wind in the immediate area.\n- Within this vortex, countless microscopic wind blades are created, so many that even the Sharingan can't count them all.\n- The wind blades pierce every cell in the body, disconnecting them from the Chakra circulatory system and so preventing them from providing their physical energy to the chakra-creation process.\n- Because of this, the target loses their ability to create and mould chakra, damage which cannot be healed by medical ninjutsu.\n- Tsunade likens the damage to poison, and warns that if the damage is great enough, those affected by it won't be able to use jutsu again.\n- The Rasenshuriken causes cellular damage not only to his targets, but to the arm Naruto holds the Rasenshuriken with, though the damage isn't quite as severe.\n- Naruto is able to overcome these flaws by learning senjutsu.\n- By infusing the Rasenshuriken with senjutsu chakra, its shape is maintained after formation, meaning that he can use it as a projectile and, as a result, that he no longer needs to worry about damaging himself.\n- When thrown, the Rasenshuriken travels very quickly, enough to cross the crater of Chibaku Tensei in under a second.\n- Once thrown, Naruto can remotely expand the Rasenshuriken to either compensate for imprecise aim or to catch dodging targets, though its speed is great enough that this is rarely necessary.\n- He enjoys similar benefits while using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, where he can use his chakra arms to guide the Rasenshuriken to its target while he remains at a safe distance.\n- Moreover, he can use these chakra arms in place of the usual shadow clones.\n- Naruto eventually starts making the Rasenshuriken a template for other jutsu, just as he does with the regular Rasengan.\n- Like the Rasengan, some of the simpler modifications he makes to the Rasenshuriken are by using multiple simultaneously or making them larger (or even smaller).\n- In place of the Rasengan he uses for the centre of the Rasenshuriken, he can use Tailed Beast Balls or Truth-Seeking Balls that will create significantly larger explosions upon detonation.\n- He can also apply other natures to the Rasenshuriken, as he does with the Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken.\n- * Like the Rasengan, the Rasenshuriken's colour is depicted inconsistently in the series because Masashi Kishimoto has yet to decide upon a colour for the technique.\n- It is most often depicted as being a bluish-white, but different promotional and supplementary material have also shown it as red or orange with no obvious pattern.\n- The sphere begins forming in his hand, but it becomes unstable and disperses, backfiring on him.\n- * In certain games, when the senjutsu version of the Rasenshuriken is thrown, it will hit and carry its target into the air before exploding.\n- This version is referred to as the .\n"
