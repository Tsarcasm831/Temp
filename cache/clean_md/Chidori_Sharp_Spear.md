## Summary
The original Chidori gained its power by shaping it into a form sufficient for an electrical discharge and using it together with the user's own "thrust". This technique uses shape transformation to form the original Chidori into a spear or blade-shape, adapting it for mid-range attacks with a maximum range of about five metres.

## Drawbacks
- Its increased range means there is less of a risk to the user.

## Notes
- It also has the advantage of being able to be used for surprise attacks and capturing.
- When the enemy's body is pierced, the user can alter the spear's shape into multiple additional blades, increasing the number of wounds.
- The blade can also be swung in order to cut things as well as cause fatal injuries.
- Sasuke has shown that he can also channel this technique through his chokutō.
- Because of Sasuke's mastery in kenjutsu, this technique can act as a makeshift sword if he loses his sword.
- After infusing this technique with Six Paths Chakra, Sasuke was able to bisect through the revived Madara in his jinchūriki form.
