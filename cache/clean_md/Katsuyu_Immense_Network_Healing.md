## Summary
Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing is a cooperation ninjutsu used by Katsuyu and its summoner using the link shared via the Strength of a Hundred Seal. The slug's summoner then channels their medical chakra through Katsuyu, who in turn transfers it to the wounded person, healing their wounds, restoring their stamina and chakra reserves.
