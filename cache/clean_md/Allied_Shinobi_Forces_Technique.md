## Summary
The Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is a combination of many techniques devised by Shikaku Nara, using the unique abilities of the Allied Shinobi Forces to combat the Ten-Tails. Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.

## Usage
- * In Naruto ShippÅ«den: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it.

## Drawbacks
- The second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.
- With the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.
- * Despite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.

## Notes
- The first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust.
- Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills.
- Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.
