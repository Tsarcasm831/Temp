## Summary
By using the existing rain around them, the user infuses their chakra into the individual raindrops, sharpening them into ultra-thin needles to fall down and skew their targets. Because of its minuscule nature and how they blend in with the rest of the rain, it is hard for a person to discern the true nature of this technique without prior knowledge.
