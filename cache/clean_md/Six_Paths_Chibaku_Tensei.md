## Counters / Defenses
- The only known method of breaking this seal is for a wielder of the Rinnegan to summon the core out of the resulting satellite.
- Centuries later, the spirit of Hagoromo passed on the seals required to activate this technique to Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, who went on to perform the same feat, resealing Kaguya Ōtsutsuki — alongside Black Zetsu — inside of a new moon contained within her core dimension.
- Later, in episode 464, Hagoromo claims he sealed both Kaguya and Ten-Tails inside the moon.
- ** In the anime, when Hagoromo and Hamura used this technique to seal Kaguya, the Six Paths Yin and Yang seals did not appear in her third eye, and her chakra was not extracted from her body.

## Notes
- However, in episode 462, they are instead depicted using this technique on Kaguya herself, while Ten-Tails' body withers away like a tree.
