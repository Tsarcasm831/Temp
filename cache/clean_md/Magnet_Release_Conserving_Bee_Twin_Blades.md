# Magnet Release: Conserving Bee Twin Blades

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Magnet Release
- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Magnet Release, Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Mid
- Users: Toroi
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Through the Magnet Release kekkei genkai, the user is able to magnetise anything they touch, and then subsequently anything that touches something they have already magnetised, and so on. However, the magnetic force weakens from object to object.

## Counters / Defenses
- Any individual that comes into direct contact with these shuriken themselves are magnetised; as such, it is crucial that the opponent avoids all of them as even a single deflection will result in the production of a powerful magnetic field around their body.

## Notes
- Once a person has been magnetised, the user can manipulate the magnetic field in such a manner as to make any subsequent attack using a metallic weapon impossible to evade.
- Toroi uses his Magnet Release to magnetise a large quantity of shuriken, which he then throws in the direction of his opponents.
