## Summary
Gaara forms small lumps of sand high in the air, which he has fall on a target like rain. Gaara can control the sand lumps with his chakra, allowing him to ensure they strike their target and even guide them towards the target's blind-spots.

## Counters / Defenses
- Because this control allows Gaara to strike the target from multiple directions at once, the target's attention will be focused upwards as they attempt to avoid it.

## Notes
- As such, the technique is an effective distraction, allowing Gaara to use another source of sand to attack the target from underfoot.
