## Summary
The user spits flames from their mouth that, like a dragon's, quickly travel forward in a straight direction. Upon contact with a target, the affected area is engulfed in flames.

## Notes
- Whereas the Great Fireball Technique will burn everything in the vicinity, the Dragon Fire Technique is more narrowly focused at its initial target, likened to a projectile.
- The anime later shows it burning through a line of enemies, with the flames moving from one enemy to the next.
- Despite these two cases, the Dragon Fire Technique seemingly does not require a medium through which to be transmitted.
- * In Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!, the blaze splits into multiple smaller dragons of fire that strike the foe from multiple directions.
- * Jiraiya uses this technique in "The New Erotic Ninjutsu Completed!!", which was later adapted in Naruto: ShippÅ«den .
