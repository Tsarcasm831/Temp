## Summary
The user kneads chakra, along with natural energy and then converts it into large amount of high-viscosity water within their mouth before spitting it outward with an incredible amount of force. The projectile-like force of this technique combined with its monstrous volume gives it the capability to quickly cover a wide area.

## Notes
- It takes the form of a clear, thick, and most of all sticky liquid.
- It can be literally translated as "Water Candy", emphasising its likeness to water and explaining why it is used in a Water Release technique.
