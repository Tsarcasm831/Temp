## Summary
The Six Paths Yin Power is a power wielded by Hamura and Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, and later given to Sasuke Uchiha. It is represented by a dark-coloured, crescent moon-like on the user's left hand.

## Counters / Defenses
- When the Yin and Yang powers are used together, they can seal and transform their target into the core of the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei technique.
- When Sasuke did so in conjunction with Naruto Uzumaki's Six Paths Yang Power, the palm seal on his left hand vanished, returning to Hagoromo's own left hand.

## Notes
- It can be presumed that it augments the user's abilities.
- As noted by Black Zetsu, there is a special resonance between the Six Paths Yin and Yang powers, allowing the wielders to sense each other's presence.
