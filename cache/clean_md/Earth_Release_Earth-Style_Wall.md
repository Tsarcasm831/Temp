## Summary
This technique allows the user to create a protective wall out of earth. One method of doing this is for the user to convert chakra in their body into an earthen material that they spit from their mouth; the more skilled the user, the greater the volume of earth that can be created.

## Counters / Defenses
- Although the muddy material is solid on its own, it is further fortified with a coat of chakra, making it more resistant to fire and water than it would otherwise be.

## Notes
- The earth quickly piles up into a defensive wall, blocking incoming attacks.
- Walls erected in this way are typically featureless, but users can alter the appearance if they choose; Kakashi Hatake adorns his with bulldog sculptures.
- Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.
- The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.
- In Kakashi Retsuden , the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the Fourth Shinobi World War, to make up for the loss of his Sharingan.
- His improved Earth-Style Wall is large enough to surround a small village, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannons, and he can remotely repair any damage it receives.
- Kakashi is able to maintain such a wall for over a day by himself, something most onlookers believe would require the work of team.
