## Summary
After kneading chakra in the stomach and converting it to high-viscosity water, the user spits it out, in the form of ropes that restrains the target's movement. Because of the viscosity of the water, it is even more difficult for them to escape its confines.

## Notes
- It takes the form of a clear, thick, and most of all sticky liquid.
- It can be literally translated as "water candy", emphasising its likeness to water and explaining why it is used in a water release technique.
- * In the anime, the Genjutsu World version of Izumo Kamizuki is able to use this technique.
