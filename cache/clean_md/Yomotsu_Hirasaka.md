## Summary
Yomotsu Hirasaka is a kekkei mōra technique used by members of the Ōtsutsuki clan, which is said to be the progenitor of all space–time ninjutsu. The openings can be used to connect two different spatial locations within the same dimension, or to create a pathway that links two dimensions together.

## Usage
- These portals can be used to transport only sections of the user's body by partially entering them, allowing the user to grab their opponents and drag them into the portal, sending them to another location.

## Counters / Defenses
- * Obito Uchiha was able to synchronise his Kamui with Kaguya's Yomotsu Hirasaka to gain access to her six dimensions.

## Notes
- By entering these spacial tears, the user is able to retreat, disorient enemies, or execute ambush attacks at a moment's notice.
- Kaguya Ōtsutsuki used this technique to travel between her six dimensions.
- Kaguya can also open rifts to transport her attacks through the portals, relocating projectiles and ultimately taking the enemy down by surprise.
- The portals are manifested at such speeds that even a shinobi as fast as Sasuke Uchiha was caught off guard.
- However, evading the portals is still possible.
- * In the anime, this was the first jutsu used on Earth.
- * Black Zetsu was able to use this technique while residing inside the sleeve of Kaguya's severed arm.
- * At times, Urashiki Ōtsutsuki activates his Rinnegan before using this technique, though he can also use it without doing so.
