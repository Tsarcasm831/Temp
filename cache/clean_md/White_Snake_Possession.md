## Summary
Orochimaru transfers his consciousness into a white snake and then slithers into his target's body, enabling him to gain control of their body as well as their mind. This technique is similar in concept to the Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Switch Technique, where the user's original body is left defenceless after taking control of someone else's.
