## Summary
This is a rudimentary Earth Release technique used by shinobi of Iwagakure. After forming the necessary hand seals, the user places their hands on the ground and creates a solid wall to serve as a defensive barricade, manipulating pre-existing earth to rise up and take form.

## Notes
- Though weak, these walls can serve as a makeshift blockade when formed by several users, slowing down large and powerful attacks.
- Using this technique is apparently extremely simple, to the point where it can be taught to even non-primary Earth Release users in a matter of seconds.
