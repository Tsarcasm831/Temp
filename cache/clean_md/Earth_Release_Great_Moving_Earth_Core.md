## Summary
This technique grants the user the ability to freely lower or raise the terrain within a specific area surrounding them, in a similar manner to its parent technique, albeit on a much larger scale. This allows them to create giant holes or elevations in the ground, one of which was large enough to trap the Ten-Tails in.
