## Summary
This is a more practical application of the Multi-Size Technique. Rather than increase the size of their entire body, the user increases the size of only specific body parts, typically the arms and legs.

## Notes
- Because of the larger size, physical attacks made with the expanded limbs do greater damage than normal.
- The limbs' growth is very fast, giving users a way of taking opponents by surprise.
- In the anime, the expanded mass can also be used a powerful defense from blunt-force assaults, cushioning the impact to negate it.
- As with other techniques of the Akimichi clan, its chakra requirements are quite high,
