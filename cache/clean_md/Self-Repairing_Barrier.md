## Summary
The Self-Repairing Barrier is a Cooperation Ninjutsu that by linking chakra from a team of ninja, will create a barrier which if damaged, will constantly repair itself with said chakra that emanates from their bodies. The barrier also prevents those outside of it from sensing anything inside it through traditional methods.

## Counters / Defenses
- However, Naruto Uzumaki transformed into his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and forced the Tailed Beast Ball to push the rest of the way through with B following, showing it could not withstand the assault of two jinchūriki.

## Notes
- The users can erect as much as 36 barriers, with the highest number being able to stop and contain any individual jinchūriki.
- It proved to be strong enough to take a direct Tailed Beast Ball from Killer B, with only nine of the thirty-six barriers shattering.
