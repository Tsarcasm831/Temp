## Summary
Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi is a technique which applies shape transformation to the black flames of Amaterasu, allowing the user to manipulate them at will. In Sasuke Uchiha's case, while Amaterasu is cast from his left eye, he uses his right eye to manipulate the flames.

## Usage
- * The black flames can be used simultaneously with the Chidori to enhance the latter's destructive power.

## Counters / Defenses
- * Converging the flames in front of the user, a barrier of spike-shaped flames can be created that not only shields him, but also pierces and burns any opponent that touches it.

## Notes
- * While using the ribcage state of Susanoo, the user can create a defensive encampment by manipulating the flames to cover it.
- * The user can wield the flames in their hand without being incinerated, as well as manipulate them into a flexible sword which launches spike-shaped projectiles when swung.
- * The user wraps it around their sword, increasing its potency.
- Kagutsuchi is the God of Fire in Shinto and the one who brought death into the world by burning his mother, Izanami, to death as she gave birth to him.
- This made his father, Izanagi, kill him with the Sword of Totsuka.
- Although the sword formed in this manner was initially identified as "Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi", it was later named as part of a derivative technique called "Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi".
- In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , it is named "Sword of Kagutsuchi".
- * In chapter 585, the furigana of this technique's name were written in hiragana, not in katakana, as they're usually written.
- * According to the fourth databook, Sasuke invented this technique when he fought A, The only people who are confirmed to have wielded the Mangekyō during his lifetime were Madara Uchiha and Izuna Uchiha.
- ** In the anime, Sasuke is able to put out the black flames of Amaterasu using Kagutsuchi.
- This resembles the manga, where he put the black flames out as well, although this happened before his alleged invention of the technique.
