# Lion Combo

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Sasuke Uchiha, Kakashi Hatake~game
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
This technique is unique to Sasuke Uchiha, relying on his advanced physical condition and his "knack" for rapid combo attacks. Sasuke kicks a target into the air and follows close behind them.

## Usage
- The higher up they get and the faster they move, the more damage that will be caused to the target when, as his finishing blow after punching them down, Sasuke inevitably kicks them back to the ground with a heel drop.

## Counters / Defenses
- While in the air, Sasuke provokes the target into attacking him, giving him the chance to counter them and, in turn, kick them higher into the air at increasingly greater speeds and/or to flank their sides with another kick.

## Notes
- * In Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow , the first Ninja Council and Jump Super Stars , the Lion Combo is done fully in midair without falling to the ground.
- ** The first Ultimate Ninja Storm and the rest of the sub-series also has this technique regulated to being Part 1 Sasuke's midair string, being the one version of the Lion Combo that does not require the initial launching kick to perform nor requiring usage of Shadow of the Dancing Leaf, with Sasuke already needing to be in midair from a normal jump to perform it instead.
- *** In the localisation of the Storm games, it is erroneously name-swapped with his close-range attack down string finisher's name (Great Flame Axe AKA Blaze Ax).
- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Part 2 Hebi Sasuke performs a version of this technique where instead of ending with a kick as he falls, he finishes with the victim falling onto his upwards Chidori instead.
