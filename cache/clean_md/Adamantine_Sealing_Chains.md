## Summary
This is a sealing technique that is characteristic of the Uzumaki clan. The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.

## Usage
- When she was the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious, and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.

## Counters / Defenses

- A barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.
- but Jin no Sho describes it only as a "glimpse" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.

## Notes
- Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.
- Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides.
