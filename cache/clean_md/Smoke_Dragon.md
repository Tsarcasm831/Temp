# Smoke Dragon

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Kihō
- Media: Anime

## Summary
By unleashing a continuous stream of smoke from his wrist launcher, Kihō can use his chakra to shape the smoke into the form of a dragon linked to his wrist launcher. This gives him the advantage of short range attacks, and because the dragon is completely composed of smoke, physical attacks are useless against it.

## Notes
- He could also form several smoke dragons at once.
- Its primary battle ability is to envelop and suffocate the target.
- However, as smoke is dissolved when it comes into contact with water, this technique is weak against water-based attacks.
