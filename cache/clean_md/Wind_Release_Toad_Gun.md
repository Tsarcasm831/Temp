## Summary
The Wind Release: Toad Gun is a two-way cooperation ninjutsu between Naruto and Gamatatsu. It is a wind-infused version of the Water Release: Water Gun technique.

## Usage
- This technique creates a powerful and fast stream of water, which eventually spreads to cover a much larger area, but maintaining a powerful striking force due to the wind chakra.

## Notes
- To set up for this technique, Naruto stands behind or atop Gamatatsu, moulding his wind chakra, while Gamatatsu moulds his own chakra and keeps water in his mouth.
- When ready, Naruto signals Gamatatsu to exhale all of the water through his mouth, combined with the wind chakra that Naruto channelled into Gamatatsu.
- The attack was strong enough to break through Guren's Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Labyrinth Technique, which was suggested to be powerful enough to withstand the Rasengan.
