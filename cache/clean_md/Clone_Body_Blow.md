# Clone Body Blow

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques,
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Naruto Uzumaki
- Media: Anime, Manga, Movie

## Summary
Naruto and four shadow clones work together to deliver a physical attack from a distance. There is no set pattern, steps, or method to how this is done, instead relying on Naruto's characteristic unpredictability to be devised in the moment.

## Notes
- When he uses this against Gaara, three shadow clones distract Gaara while the fourth throws Naruto at him, intended to deliver a body blow.
- Because one of his shadow clones is throwing him, Naruto's body blow ends up being more accurate and damaging than what he could do on his own.
