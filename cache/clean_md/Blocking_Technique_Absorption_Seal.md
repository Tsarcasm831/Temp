## Summary
A highly advanced sealing technique granted by the Preta Path, that conjures a see-through barrier around the user's body that is capable of absorbing any chakra, regardless of any shape or nature transformation, and dispersing it within one's body by spinning the chakra within one's body in the opposite direction. As a result, this technique can absorb any ninjutsu based technique, rendering it ineffective on the user.
