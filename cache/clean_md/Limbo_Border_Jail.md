## Summary
Limbo: Border Jail is a unique dōjutsu awakened by Madara Uchiha's Rinnegan. With one Rinnegan, Madara can form only one shadow, but with two Rinnegan, he can form up to four.

## Counters / Defenses
- * Alongside the Six Paths Ten-Tails Coffin Seal, Madara could not use this technique as a reincarnated corpse.

## Notes
- Each shadow has the same abilities as the real Madara, with the added advantage of being untrackable.
- or they can defend Madara, giving the appearance of an invisible wall around him.
- The shadows are invulnerable to any kind of physical damage and cannot be harmed through conventional means.
- After a certain amount of time, a shadow will need to return to Madara's body, and he will likewise need to wait a certain amount of time before he can reform it.
- Against most opponents, Madara's shadows give him an insurmountable advantage.
- But Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, after receiving Six Paths chakra, undermine some of the shadows' usual benefits: Sasuke can see them with his own Rinnegan; Naruto can sense them while using Six Paths Sage Mode;
