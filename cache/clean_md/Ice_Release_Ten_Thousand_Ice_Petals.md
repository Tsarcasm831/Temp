## Summary
The user unleashes a barrage of ice darts. The intensity of the cold is so great, that should a person attempt to block them, it will cause severe damage to the afflicted limb.

## Notes
- The user can also use this defensively by creating a wall of ice to create distance between the user and their combatant.
- The hardness of the ice itself along with its momentum is dangerous.
- A metal sliding door on a Thunder Rail car was severely dented and deformed when it buckled under an onslaught until it was torn from its frame and railings.
