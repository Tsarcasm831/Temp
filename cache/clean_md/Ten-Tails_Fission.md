# Ten-Tails Fission

## Quick Facts
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Ten-Tails, Ten-Tails (Kara)
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Used primarily as a defensive manoeuvre, the Ten-Tails has the ability to perform biological fission, extruding pieces of its body to create smaller entities that resemble itself, known as Fission Beings. After being produced these creatures will act in a coordinated fashion to defend the main body from perceived threats.

## Notes
- As part of this technique, the Ten-Tails can also separate and purge injured parts from its main body.
- This was done after part of its body was set ablaze by Amaterasu.
- Code utilised his Claw Marks to forcefully pinch off pieces of the juvenile Ten-Tails in Kara's captivity, which then reformed into humanoid forms he named Claw Grime.
