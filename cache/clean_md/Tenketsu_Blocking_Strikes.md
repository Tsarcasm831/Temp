# Tenketsu Blocking Strikes

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Shira
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
A taijutsu technique that allows the user to disable an opponent by performing a two-fingered thrust at the opponent's tenketsu. By doing so, the user can manipulate the flow of chakra within their opponent, similar the the Gentle Fist fighting style.

## Notes
- Shira can unblock his opponents' tenketsu, with a single impact with his fist.
- While seemingly not hampering the opponent in any other way, it seems to prevent the opponent from initiating the surge of chakra when the Eight Gates are opened.
- This shows very advanced aim and physiological knowledge on Shira's part.
