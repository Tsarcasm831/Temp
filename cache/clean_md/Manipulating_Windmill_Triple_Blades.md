# Manipulating Windmill Triple Blades

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Mid
- Users: Sasuke Uchiha
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user attaches one end of a wire string to a shuriken and the other end to a kunai. The user throws the shuriken at a target, expecting that the target will dodge it.

## Counters / Defenses
- The user then loops the kunai around a tree (or something similar) and throws the kunai, which the target will also dodge.

## Notes
- When the kunai reaches the end of the string's length, it pulls the shuriken back towards the target, striking them from behind; Rin no Sho compares the action to a yo-yo.
- Because the manoeuvre's effectiveness relies on anticipating the target's movements, having the Sharingan is invaluable to its success.
