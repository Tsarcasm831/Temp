## Summary
The user manipulates a volume of water with their hand; by thrusting their hand in a direction, the manipulated water is sent in that direction. As it moves, the body of water takes the shape of a shark, with additional water following in its wake for as long as the user keeps their hand thrust out.

## Notes
- Because of how quickly the shark moves and because of how much water there is, it does extensive damage when it impacts something.
- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes , the shark is depicted as purple instead of blue.
