## Summary
Limelight is a lightning-based technique that is used when all four users take place in the cardinal directions. They will then join their lightning-chakra in the form of four connecting streams that shoot high into the sky above the target area.

## Notes
- It will then create a massive ball of lightning powerful enough to incinerate everything within the area of the four users.
- It is considered to be the most powerful and destructive Lightning Release technique.
- While walking towards their designated positions, the users will generate fluctuating pillars of electricity from their bodies.
- As the technique requires all four users to be in position, if even one of them is disabled, then Limelight cannot activate at all.
