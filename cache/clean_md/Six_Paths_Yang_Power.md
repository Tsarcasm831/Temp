## Summary
The Six Paths Yang Power is a power wielded by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki and later given to Naruto Uzumaki. It is represented by a light-coloured, sun-like on the user's right hand.

## Counters / Defenses
- When the Yin and Yang powers are used together, they can seal and transform their target into the core of the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei technique.
- When Naruto did so in conjunction with Sasuke Uchiha's Six Paths Yin Power, the palm seal on his right hand vanished, returning to Hagoromo's own right hand.

## Notes
- It is possible that it augments the user's other abilities.
- As noted by Black Zetsu, there is a special resonance between the Six Paths Yin and Yang powers, allowing the wielders to sense each other's presence.
- This was removed in the tankōbon version.
