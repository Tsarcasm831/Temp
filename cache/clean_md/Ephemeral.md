# Ephemeral

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Yin Release
- Classification: Genjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Itachi Uchiha
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
This technique allows Itachi to put his opponent within a genjutsu by using his finger as a medium. This induces the genjutsu.

## Counters / Defenses
- When the technique was used on Naruto Uzumaki, crows flocked from Itachi and turned into shuriken after he performed the ram seal which bombarded Naruto, and then attempted to put him to sleep.
- When he resisted the sleep command, Naruto then experienced the sensation of his body parts turning into his closest friends who then tortured him psychologically.
- This is implied to be an extra stage of the genjutsu caused by Itachi after performing the ram seal.

## Notes
- The same goes along with his use of shuriken.
- It is instead given a name in Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen!
- EX .
- These video game variations only consist of the damage caused by the crow-turned-shuriken, with Itachi finishing his foe off with a sword slash.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4 , this technique is called "Genjutsu: Bubbles".
- This may be an allusion to the impermanence of bubbles and "Ephemeral" literally meaning something akin to "for a moment" or a short while, "bubbles" also being a translation for the technique's name, making use of wordplay.
