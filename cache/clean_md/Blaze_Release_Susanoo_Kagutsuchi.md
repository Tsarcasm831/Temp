## Summary
An application of Kagutsuchi through Susanoo, whereby Sasuke produces weapons made from the orb of black flames held in his Susanoo's secondary right hand. * Magatama-shaped projectiles can be unleashed from the orb in volleys, knocking back and subsequently incinerating their targets.

## Usage
- * When portrayed in the anime, the orb held by Susanoo and the blade it produces appear to be made of the same ethereal substance as the rest of Susanoo, rather than black flames as it appears in the manga and games.

## Notes
- * This technique can produce arrows to be utilised with Susanoo's bow.
- Instead, the orb briefly changes into black flames when using certain techniques.
