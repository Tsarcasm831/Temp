- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Guren

## Summary
This technique, which seems to be Crystal Release: Crystal Pentagonal Prison on a smaller scale or a minor version of it, allows Guren to completely encase a single target in a compact mass of pink crystals. If the crystals are shattered, the victim disintegrates along with the crystal particles.

## Counters / Defenses
- However, Hinata was able to surround her body with chakra before she was completely encased, thereby avoiding the fatal disintegration effect.

## Notes
- Therefore, this jutsu has no effect on chakra.
