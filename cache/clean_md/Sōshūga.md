## Summary
is the name of a fighting style employing a pair of nunchaku by Might Guy. Guy wields these with great dexterity, utilising all of his limbs at times, making use of them particularly during situations where direct physical contact must be avoided.

## Counters / Defenses
- The weapons are first seen in use during the later stages of the Fourth Shinobi World War but, during the course of the confrontation with Tobi, they were soon absorbed by the former.

## Notes
- Making use of his own impressive strength, he can even crush large boulders using this technique.
- After the war, Guy wields a pair of nunchaku once again.
