## Summary
This medical technique forms one's chakra into a small, sharp blade. This can then be used for highly accurate incisions necessary for surgeries and anatomical dissections.

## Drawbacks
- Unlike regular scalpels, the chakra scalpel can make cuts inside the body without actually creating an open wound, limiting the risks of an infection.

## Notes
- The chakra scalpel can also be used offensively to inflict internal damage, although it requires great precision to be effective.
- Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual.
- In heated combat, even the greatest medical-nin won't be able to exert the precision needed to target the vital spots, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile.
- Kabuto has displayed enough skill with the technique to be able to deliver fatal cuts that can target vital spots, even cutting through wood and flesh with ease.
- He could also sever the chakra pathway system, which prevented a jinchūriki from receiving chakra from their tailed-beast.
- When enhanced with natural energy, he can even use it to sever a person’s body in half.
- It was written as , which would usually be pronounced as "Chakura Kaibōtō".
- "Mesu" is derived from the word "Mes", which is scalpel in Dutch.
- * Shizune uses this technique as a major portion of her fighting style in the Ultimate Ninja game series.
