## Summary
The Lightning Release: Lariat is a powerful taijutsu technique whereby the user charges at their opponent, striking them with a Lariat move, which can be coated in chakra. A successful strike can blow away a target's entire chest with a direct hit, which may not kill them right away, but will ultimately kill them if they are not treated.

## Usage
- In Killer B's Version 2, the Lariat gains an increase in power due to the ox-skull he creates.

## Notes
- The attack is rather straightforward, but very quick, powerful and is easily capable of knocking down an opponent.
- He refers to this as his sword, next to his seven conventional katana.
- He was able to pierce Samehada while simultaneously blowing away Kisame Hoshigaki's chest.
- * When A uses it, he surrounds himself with his Lightning Release Chakra Mode, rather than tailed-beast chakra.
- His high-level chakra, which is comparable to that of a tailed beast's, would produce the same effect as Killer B's version.
- The two brothers can combine their efforts to perform a Lightning Release: Double Lariat, which is strong enough to decapitate the victim, even without chakra enhancements, due to the brothers' immense physical strength.
- Also, it is taught to the ninja, usually the Raikage's sibling, who earns the title of "B" so as to be a tag-team partner with the Raikage and be able to perform this technique simultaneously on the same target.
- * As with many of the techniques of Kumogakure ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.
- Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as Rairi Nett≈ç .
- * Similarly to the Fourth Raikage's Liger Bomb, the Lariat is a highly feared move within Puroresu (Japanese professional wrestling).
- Killer B even shouts "Wheee!" when attacking with the Lariat, a nod to pro wrestler Stan Hansen who popularised the Lariat in Japan.
- * In the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm , Might Guy's "Oneself's Rule" shows him performing what appears to be a regular lariat.
