# Fighting Tongue Slash

## Quick Facts

- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Fukasaku
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
By kneading senjutsu chakra, Fukasaku's long tongue gains utmost solidity and sharpness. It then leaps from his mouth with tremendous speed and force, enough to tear a hole through bedrock and metal pipes with ease.

## Notes
- With that ground-splitting power, the enemy is cut in half.
- The way that both the enemy and the ground itself are cut apart is reminiscent of the strike of a great sword.
- It can be translated as to "battle with tongues" .
- In normal use, however, it means "war of words" , or "verbal dispute" , in reference to Fukasaku and Shima arguing all the time.
- The full kanji can be translated as "War of Words Slash".
- * In the anime, colourised manga, and various video games, Fukasaku is depicted firing a highly pressurised stream of water from his mouth, rather than extending his tongue.
