## Summary
Chidori Current is a ninjutsu that was developed by Sasuke Uchiha while he was training with Orochimaru. When using this attack on a great number of enemies at once, it can effectively double as an instant defence.

## Notes
- The body of the person touched by the Chidori will misinterpret the lightning nature as "electrical signals from the nerves", making its muscles contract.
- This causes the body to involuntarily go stiff, while at the same time receiveing damage.
- This attack can also be channelled through the ground to increase the range of the attack.
