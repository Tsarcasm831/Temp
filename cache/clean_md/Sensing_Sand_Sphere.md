# Sensing Sand Sphere

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Long
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This sphere, made out of sand, can be used to monitor chakra signatures in a given area. The sphere itself is not a great form of detection and needs on-the-field reports to locate targets that should be kept track of.

## Notes
- When linked with a Sensing Barrier, this imprecision is mitigated somewhat.
