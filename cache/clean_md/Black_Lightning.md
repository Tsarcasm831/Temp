## Notes
- This seems to be a distinctive tradition, as Ginkaku and Kinkaku recognised Darui's possession of this ability through his tattoo.
- * Sasuke Uchiha demonstrated the ability to use something resembling this when he fought against Naruto Uzumaki at the Valley of the End in Part I, and when he attacked Madara Uchiha in the Fourth Shinobi World War after receiving Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's power.
- * Kakashi Hatake's lightning attack also became black in colour after receiving the Six Paths Power from Obito Uchiha while battling against Kaguya Ōtsutsuki in the Fourth Shinobi World War.
- * In the anime, Tsukiyo has displayed Lightning Release similar in appearance to this, though his has a magenta glow.
