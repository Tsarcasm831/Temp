## Summary
A toad, using its naturally strong hips and legs, leaps precisely at a target. Toads can cover a great distance by doing this, shifting from a remote location to close range suddenly in order to catch targets off guard.

## Notes
- The toad then just as quickly swings with their sword, before the target can react, shifting the power of their leap into the strike.
- When used by Gamabunta, the slash is powerful enough to sever the arm of Shukaku's Tailed Beast Mode.
