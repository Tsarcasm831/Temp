## Summary
The Mayfly is an infiltration technique, which is a signature characteristic of White Zetsu and its clone siblings, due to being infused with the cells of Hashirama Senju. His insectivorous plant-like shell has the ability to merge with the ground, because it is tinged with his chakra.

## Notes
- Then, using the underground network of organic matter, consisting of things like plant roots and water veins, he can travel everywhere with high speed.
- Using this technique he can conceal himself in such things as trees and even sand.
- Once merged, his presence is completely concealed, making it impossible to detect him, even for sensor type ninja like Karin.
