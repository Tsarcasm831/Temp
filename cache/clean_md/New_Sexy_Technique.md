## Summary
During his two-and-a-half years of training with Jiraiya, Naruto Uzumaki on one occasion uses the Sexy Technique against Jiraiya; Naruto transforms into a woman wearing a revealing devil outfit and short shorts. After seeing it, Jiraiya encourages Naruto to take a form that is wearing a thong, which he believes will give him inspiration.

- He complains bitterly until Naruto, irritated, uses the form to knock Jiraiya out.
- Naruto brags about this "new" Sexy Technique when he returns to Konohagakure, claiming it's far superior to the original.
- He is attacked by Sakura Haruno before he has a chance to demonstrate it.
