## Summary
The user moves at a target at high speeds and delivers a body slam. Because of how quickly they move, the user travels in a fairly straight line, necessitating that they anticipate the target's movements in order to ensure a successful strike.

## Notes
- As they move at the target, the user spins rapidly in order to pierce targets, drilling even through stone.
- Unlike the Fang Passing Fang, this technique is performed alone; users therefore require additional training to raise its attack power enough to compensate for this.
