## Summary
The Flaming Arrow Warhead is a technique used by Nagato through the Asura Path. The further the hand is removed from the arm, the more missiles can be fired at once.

## Drawbacks
- Even if the Asura Path has sustained significant damage, it can still produce missiles from its body, as it did when Pain attempted to kill Chōji.

## Notes
- These can fired to create widespread damage, or as homing devices seeking a single target.
