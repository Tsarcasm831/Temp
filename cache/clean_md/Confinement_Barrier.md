## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Cooperation Ninjutsu, Barrier Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Mid

## Summary
A type of barrier ninjutsu utilised by the Konoha Barrier Team. After using themselves as the perimeter for the barrier, a barrier is erected and then takes on a dome shape capable of even trapping the Nue.

## Counters / Defenses
- Similarly a Spaceâ€“Time Ninjutsu was able to reach the barrier.

## Notes
- To ensure Konoha's ability to respond to a crisis, Naruto routinely trains Konoha shinobi to use the barrier, usually releasing his own powerful chakra to test their limit.
- The barrier apparently does not prevent people from entering as the Seventh Hokage was able to enter it without any issues.
