## Quick Facts

- Classification: Hiden~Nara Clan, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Shikamaru Nara
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user materialises their shadow and increases its power, becoming like steel. The user then captures the target's shadow and forcibly moves them about.

## Usage
- When used together with the Akimichi's Human Bullet Tank, it turns it into a weapon.

## Notes
- The techniques strength is proportionate to the chakra put into it, with enough strength even giants can be moved.
- This simple application makes it useful in a number of emergency situations.
- Unlike with the Shadow Imitation Technique, though the two shadows are connected, the target is not forced to copy the user's movements, allowing them to retain their own range of motion.
