# Lightning Release: Whip Dance of Fools

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Lightning Release
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Bukijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Media: Anime

## Summary
After the user ensnares their target with their barbed metallic whip, they will channel lightning into it, shocking the target. The technique is apparently self-sustaining as the user can keep it up without paying attention to the target, and the barbs make it harder for the target to free themselves if they struggle against it.

## Notes
- * The name of this jutsu appears to be a word play with the four character idiom 無知蒙昧, which refers to the unenlightened, uneducated, and ignorant.
