## Summary
This technique subjects targets to visions of their greatest fear, regardless of whether or not they're aware that they're afraid of it. This "fear" can be something that the target is actually scared of or merely the one image that they least want to see.

## Notes
- Being presented with such a gruesome image, one that, at the time, Sakura believes to be real, gives her enough of a shock that she faints to see it.
