## Summary
The Big Ball Rasengan is a more powerful version of the Rasengan. It uses the same concept of compressing spinning chakra in one's palm as in the original Rasengan, only increasing the amount of chakra involved.

## Drawbacks
- The Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan is much larger than the original, almost being as big as Pain's summons.

## Notes
- Because there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.
- When Naruto first starts using the Big Ball Rasengan, he needs a shadow clone to help him form and wield it.
- He is able to wield it with one hand when his skill with it improves, though he still needs a clone's help in its formation.
- The size and power of his Big Ball Rasengan also improved, with it growing to nearly half the size of the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan.
- As with the original, Naruto uses a shadow clone to help him form the ball.
- With this senjutsu version, however, he can have a shadow clone form a Big Ball Rasengan in each of his hands, which he can then pass to the clones for them to wield.
- In fact, he could use this technique in Jiraiya's novel within Tsunade's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream.
- ** By the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto's regular Rasengan had increased to near Big Ball Rasengan size.
- * When Konohamaru used this technique in an OVA, he was able to use it with one hand.
