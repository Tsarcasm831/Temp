## Summary
This technique enables the user to manipulate water and moisture around oneself. In this way, the user can quickly extract and utilise groundwater or water from vegetation, should no other source be avaliable.

## Usage
- It can be used to block incoming attacks and explosions, trap or drown opponents, and shape the water into various shapes.
- Having the ability to manipulate the water from long distances allows the user, in conjunction with the Summoning Technique, to make use of water-based summonings to fight in areas that it normally wouldn't be able to.

## Counters / Defenses
- Uniquely, the user can employ a strategy to suspense countless droplets in the air in order to redirect projectiles, act as a shield, or quickly take hold of an opponent.
- As a result, Ruiga tends to avoid rocky areas where water source is scarce.

## Notes
- Should there be no avaliable water source, this technique cannot be used.
- * Ruiga uses his tonfa as dowsing rods to ensure he stays in areas with groundwater for this technique.
