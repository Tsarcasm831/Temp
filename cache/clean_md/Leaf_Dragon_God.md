# Leaf Dragon God

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Chen
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
This is the ultimate taijutsu technique created by the legendary taijutsu master Chen. It appears to be initiated by an upward spin kick at which point it quickly becomes a tornado.

## Counters / Defenses
- After initiating the attack, the user appears to remain shielded within the base of the tornado as the outward surface of the dragon seems to be solid enough for a person to impact and rebound off of, making the only way to enter the technique once it has been initiated is by being swallowed.

## Notes
- Forming into a dragon with long whiskers, it attacks the target aiming to swallow them, at which point they are cut by the razor sharp winds inside the attack.
- However, there is one distinct weakness to the technique.
- Since the Dragon God's true form is that of an ordinary tornado, its attack power is based on rotation.
- If one enters the attack's centre (Dragon's Eye) while rotating at high speed, such as Lee's One-Man Front Lotus, it can be dispersed without inflicting damage.
