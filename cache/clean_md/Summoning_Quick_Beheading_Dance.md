## Summary
Temari uses her Giant Folding Fan to create a whirlwind that is powerful enough to travel several hundred metres. As she swings the fan, she summons Kamatari, which travels upon the winds and rapidly cuts through everything in its path.

## Usage
- The debris that Kamatari creates, as well as anything else in the area, is picked up by the winds and crushes whatever it is flung against.

## Notes
- Because of how extensive this technique's damage and how wide an area it covers, it is most useful against hiding opponents or when the user is surrounded.
- The terrain is left flattened afterwards, which also means the user's location is exposed.
