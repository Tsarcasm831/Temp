## Summary
The user has a large amount of their kikaichū spread out over a wide area around themselves, having them emit a small amount of the chakra they usually feed on to confuse sensor-type shinobi. As the insects' irregular distribution and grouping together result in the creation of numerous chakra signals, it makes it more difficult to distinguish the user's actual location.

## Notes
- * — as used in the name of this technique — are common, everyday items that have become so symbolic of the traditional Japanese way of life, that they are now regarded as a kind of folk art.
