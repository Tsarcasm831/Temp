## Summary
This technique lets the user create a three-sided wall of electricity to bind their opponent. The user must have three conductors to stick in the ground to create the points.

## Notes
- Furthermore, once the enemy is inside, if they come into contact with the wall they will be electrocuted.
- The only way the technique can be broken is if an outside party were to strike one of the walls with a strong enough attack, which will then deactivate the other walls.
