## Quick Facts

- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara Uchiha, Obito Uchiha<!--Do NOT add Nagato as a user-->
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Through the Outer Path, the user is able to manifest chakra chains, which bind anyone they touch. According to Obito, this binding power is far greater than that of Nagato's Outer Path.

## Usage
- When Madara retrieved his Rinnegan and took control of the statue, he used it to produce chains with tips shaped like a dragon's head.

## Counters / Defenses
- The chains possess a cursed seal that suppresses the power of tailed beasts, and also cause a great deal of pain to their victims.
- By manifesting chains from the jinchūriki's receivers and connecting them to his hand, he was able to bind and suppress the tailed beasts inside them in the event that they resisted his control.
- The beasts were also bound by chains within their consciousness; when the receivers were removed from their jinchūriki's bodies, these chains were replaced by a single larger chain connecting directly to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, permitting Obito to quickly reseal them into the statue.
- These chains were able to quickly restrain and seal all nine tailed beasts by wrapping around their necks like collars and dragging them into the statue.

## Drawbacks
- He implanted a single receiver into each of his Six Paths of Pain, which were made into temporary jinchūriki.

## Notes
- Obito was able to generate these chains through the use of black receivers.
- The Demonic Statue itself is able to emit chakra chains from its mouth.
- The chains are also capable of extracting tailed beasts from their jinchūriki, as well as preventing them from cancelling their Tailed Beast Mode.
- In the event that they are severed, these chains can easily be reconnected.
