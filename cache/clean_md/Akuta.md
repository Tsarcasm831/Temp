## Notes
- They are able to phase through the earthen ground for travel and drag their enemies with them, as well as extend their limbs.
- While they have no fear, they have a limited lifespan and intelligence, being capable of obeying instructions and communicating with fabrications.
- Their masks are their weakness, the destruction of which would lead to their deaths.
- While deemed to have no will, this was proven false in Akkun's existence, a small Akuta who gained affection to Inojin Yamanaka, and even defied its comrades to protect him.
- Kirara deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits.
- When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against Ōnoki's orders.
- When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led Kurotsuchi to reject the technique's further development.
- Despite this, Ōnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.
- Iwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced.
- It was later destroyed by Konohamaru Sarutobi.
