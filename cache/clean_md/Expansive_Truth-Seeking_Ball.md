The Expansive Truth-Seeking Ball is a Kekkei Mōra ninjutsu used by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. It is composed of all five elemental nature transformations as well as Yin–Yang Release.

## Counters / Defenses
- If this happens, even previously synced Space–Time Ninjutsu will be unable to return to the new dimension.

## Notes
- A vast expanding mass of chaos with power to reshape the world by obliterating it to nothing first.
- Unlike the standard Truth-Seeking Ball, which a user starts with a set amount of spheres that cannot be regenerated if lost or destroyed, this technique does not have such limitations and can be generated from nothing.
- The sphere will continue to expand until it overwrites the previous dimension, completely annihilating it.
