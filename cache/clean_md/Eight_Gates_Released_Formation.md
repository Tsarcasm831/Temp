## Usage
- Their body will continue to heat up until it's been cooked from the inside-out, inevitably killing the user A powerful healing technique, however, can be used to save the user from death.

## Drawbacks
- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds , Shinnō claims that his Body Revival Technique, combined with Dark Chakra, allows him to open all eight gates without any drawbacks.

## Notes
- While all of the Eight Gates are open, the user's heart pumps at maximum power, granting them power a hundred times greater than they are usually capable of, far beyond that of the Five Kage.
- Might Guy is able to gradually overwhelm Madara Uchiha – the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki at the time – earning him comparisons to Hashirama Senju.
- However, the damage done to his leg from using Night Guy leaves him wheelchair-bound for the rest of his life.
- Despite the handicap, Kakashi Hiden , Konoha Shinden , and the Boruto anime all show Guy continuing his life as a ninja as best as he can.
