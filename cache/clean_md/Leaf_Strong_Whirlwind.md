- Users: Might Guy, Rock Lee~game, Naruto Uzumaki~game
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
Might Guy, using his great talent with taijutsu, concentrates all his skill into a spinning backwards kick. The kick is so fast that it cannot be seen, much less dodged, and it is delivered with such power that targets are unlikely to get up once they're struck, much less block.

## Notes
- * In the anime, Rock Lee uses this technique in his Infinite Tsukuyomi dream.
