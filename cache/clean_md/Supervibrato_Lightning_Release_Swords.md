## Summary
Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords is a form of chakra flow used by Killer B, often alongside his signature kenjutsu and his preferred blades. Even when applied to a pencil, the channeling of lightning-natured chakra increases its vibrating frequency and hence its piercing and cutting power, to an extent that exceeds those of standard Wind Release techniques.

## Counters / Defenses
- However, if the chakra flow is absorbed before the flowed object pierces, the added potency will have no effect.

## Notes
- A sword empowered by this chakra flow proved capable of blocking another sword even imbued with the Chidori, which was considered impossible to defend against.
