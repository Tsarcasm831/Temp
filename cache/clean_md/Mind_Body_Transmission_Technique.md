## Summary
The Mind Body Transmission Technique is a hijutsu utilised by members of the Yamanaka clan to telepathically communicate with people. With focus the user can communicate with multiple people at once and the targets can also communicate with one another while the technique is in effect.

## Counters / Defenses
- The more people that are connected through this technique however, the more a physical strain is put on the user, forcing them to keep the connection going for shorter periods to otherwise avoid sustaining injuries.

## Drawbacks
- Depending on the skill of the user, one may require the aid of a device to make use of this technique for connections to multiple people as Inoichi's usage to connect with the entire Allied Shinobi Forces for more than ten seconds caused him to suffer a nosebleed.

## Notes
- This technique is not limited to just transmitting thoughts.
- Images, such as memories, or even strong feelings can be conveyed.
