# Fission Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Mū
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The Fission Technique is a highly advanced ninjutsu which allows Mū to literally split his own body into two identical — yet entirely independent — duplicates of himself. Unlike clone techniques that only appear to be similar, the ability is instead a physical separation and so does not require hand seals to activate, making it faster in comparison as a result.

## Counters / Defenses
- Because the duplicates cannot be dispelled like normal clones, they will be unable to reunite if one is sealed.

## Drawbacks
- This poses a great risk to Mū as his chakra reserves are also halved in the process.

## Notes
- This also means that even if one is incapacitated, the other remains completely unaffected as neither can truly be regarded as the original.
- In doing so, he is left unable to use more taxing techniques like his Dust Release kekkei tōta.
