# Yin Seal: Release

## Quick Facts
- Classification: FÅ«injutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Sakura Haruno, Tsunade
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The Strength of a Hundred Seal - which takes the form of a diamond on the user's forehead - is used to gradually build up and store the user's chakra over time. Yin Seal: Release opens that seal, giving the user access to the accumulated chakra.

## Counters / Defenses
- Upon release, a pattern starts to appear from the diamond shape, by spreading the seal's pattern to another, the user can transfer the seal's chakra to them instead.

## Notes
- The stored chakra amounts to far more than what the user has on their own, allowing them to perform chakra-demanding jutsu that they wouldn't be able to use otherwise, such as Creation Rebirth.
