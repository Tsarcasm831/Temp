# Explosion Release: Landmine Fist

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Explosion Release
- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Explosion Release, Ninjutsu, Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Gari
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
After establishing direct contact with their opponent through a simple punch, the user utilises Explosion Release to subsequently generate an enormous explosion from the opponent's insides. This explosion is powerful enough to completely obliterate an opponent far larger than the user.

## Notes
- Due to the directionality of the blast, the user minimises any potential repercussions, such as being struck by resultant debris and even recoil appears to be completely negated.
- In the anime, Gari also uses a less-destructive version of this technique, creating a puff of smoke instead of an explosion.
