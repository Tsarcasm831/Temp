## Summary
This is a variation of the Shadow Imitation Technique, designed for offensive purposes. There, the shadow can be used for restraint, replacing or adding to the binding of the Shadow Imitation; the closer the user is to their target, the stronger this binding becomes.

## Usage
- For this reason, it is most effective when immediately used to strangle a target, hence the name.
- In The Last: Naruto the Movie , Shikamaru Nara uses the Shadow–Neck Binding to control the Ōtsutsuki clan's puppet, forcing them to fight among themselves.

## Notes
- Like the Shadow Imitation, the Shadow–Neck Binding requires a great deal of chakra to maintain, making it weaker over extended periods of time.
- * In the anime, it was shown that this technique can be manipulated in a similar manner to the Shadow Sewing Technique.
- * The technique appears in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm as Shikamaru's ultimate technique.
- However, rather than strangling the opponent, it binds them to a nearby rock and then tightly squeezes them, destroying the rock and crushing the opponent.
- * In Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 , using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name "Shadow Sinking Technique".
