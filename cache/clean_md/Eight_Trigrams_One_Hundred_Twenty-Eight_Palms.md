## Summary
The Eight Trigrams One Hundred Twenty-Eight Palms is a technique of the Gentle Fist fighting style. It is essentially a seventh step to the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms, doubling the previous barrage total and at twice the speed.

## Usage
- This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through one hundred and twenty-eight chakra points of an opponent's Chakra Pathway System.
- Alternatively, it can be used to hit a great number of targets very quickly.

## Notes
- To perform, the user crutches down while extending both arms outward, one in front and the other behind while angled like propeller blades.
- This adds another row of kanji to the envisioned Eight Trigrams symbol, extending the technique's perimeter.
- This eliminates their ability to use chakra for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move.
- Once someone is within range of the user's field of divination, they assume a Gentle Fist stance and begin to deliver the attack:
* First, two consecutive strikes to make two.
- * Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.
- * Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.
- * Fourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.
- * Fifth, sixteen consecutive strikes to make thirty-two.
- * Sixth, thirty-two consecutive strikes to make sixty-four.
- * Seventh, sixty-four consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of one hundred and twenty-eight strikes.
