## Summary
The Orochimaru-Style Body Replacement Technique is a unique form of substitution that was created by Orochimaru. After emerging, the user's clothing and injuries are completely restored, with even amputated limbs being regenerated.

## Notes
- Whilst the technique has the additional advantage of potentially being extremely difficult to detect, its use consumes a great amount of chakra.
- The technique can seemingly be used no matter how serious the injury, as Orochimaru was able to use it to materialise a new body even after Kabuto cut his throat open and grievously injured his body.
- When used by Kabuto Yakushi, who showed a more versatile use of this technique, he was able to shed his human form to reveal a humanoid-like form complete with a serpentine body.
- He later appeared with a similar serpentine body with what seemed to be smaller limbs.
- He would later use this technique to shed his body during battle as a means of taking his opponent by surprise.
