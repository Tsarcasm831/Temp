## Summary
This technique creates a giant stone monkey by accumulating surrounding ground and shaping it into the animal, which is then reinforced with fire. It's powerful enough to keep up with a fully manifested Kurama and even put it down, requiring a Susanoo support to defeat it.

## Counters / Defenses
- * In the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie , Momoshiki releases a Fire Release that he's absorbed and shapes it into a huge monkey and dog; its power is noted to be a result of the chakra he's just taken from Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki.

## Notes
- Although, it should be noted Kurama had half of its chakra drained by Momoshiki before Naruto was rescued.
- * Momoshiki's ability to create a pheasant, dog and monkey is influenced by the tale of Momotarō, who befriends the three animals.
- ** If this technique were to follow the same naming format as Inukaitakerunomikoto, it would be named , after Morihiko Sasa, one of the three retainers in the legend of Kibitsu Hiko no Mikoto.
- * In Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Voltage , Momoshiki has a version of this jutsu called in which he summons Monkey Rock to slam the ground, creating a volcanic area of erupting flames before him.
- * In Boruto episode 62, Momoshiki is briefly seen creating earthen golems.
- The golems lack the flames that would otherwise be indicative of this technique.
- The two forms are defeated by a Rasengan and Chidori.
