## Summary
This technique creates several ghost-like figures clad in black that emerge from the surrounding environment. When Mubi uses this technique, the figures are somewhat similar in appearance to him, but are not his exact lookalikes in the same that other clone techniques resemble their users.

## Notes
- The black figures move slowly towards their target, provoking the target into attacking.
- Each time the figures are struck, the attacks pass through them, only briefly disfiguring their form.
- With each attack they receive, the figures multiply.
