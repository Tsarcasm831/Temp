## Summary
Formation Ino–Shika–Chō are formations used by the members of the Yamanaka, Nara, and Akimichi clan members designed as a result of their long history of working together. This formation is usually done with flawless accuracy, which comes after working together — another testament of how close-knit the three clans are.

## Notes
- This formation is not limited to any one specific technique of any of the clans but the respective clan members can use several of their respective clan's techniques in tandem to create different versions of this formation.
- * In Shikamaru Shinden: A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals , it is revealed that relatively popular books analysing this formation have been published during the New Era, presumably because of how powerful the formation is.
