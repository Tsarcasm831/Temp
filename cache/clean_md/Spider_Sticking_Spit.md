# Spider Sticking Spit

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Kidōmaru,
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Kidōmaru spits a thick rope of webbing from his mouth at a target. The rope is very sticky because of all the webs that are layered together, which Kidōmaru can further increase (or decrease) the stickiness of by altering how much chakra flows into the rope.

## Usage
- Alternatively, the rope itself can be used to damage targets directly as a whip.

## Notes
- The rope attaches firmly to targets at the point of contact, allowing Kidōmaru to fling them around into the surroundings.
