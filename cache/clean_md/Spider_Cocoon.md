## Summary
Kidōmaru imprisons a target in a cocoon of spider threads. Because of how tightly around the target the spider threads are stretched, they are unable to move once they've been trapped.

## Notes
- Kidōmaru can further constrict the threads by flowing additional chakra into them, to the point of ultimately strangling the target.
