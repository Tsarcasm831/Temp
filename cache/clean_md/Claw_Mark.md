## Summary
A unique ability to mix chakra with the iron from the user's blood to create black bands that serve as portals to travel to previously marked locations. Once applied, they are able to freely travel to any of them, regardless of distance — even if they're in a different dimension.

## Usage
- While it only allows the user to move through them, it can take only one other person with him at a time.

## Counters / Defenses
- Although primarily chakra-based, they also contain iron from Code's blood which when mixed together causes them to become physical matter making absorption from Kāma impossible.

## Drawbacks
- He can also use them as makeshift bandages to staunch bleeding.

## Notes
- While mostly used in battle or for transportation, it can also be employed as a means of communication, putting the user' mouth or ear through them to contact Ada.
- When his limiters were active, the number of Claw Marks Code could create each time was severely limited.
- Once they were removed, he could create enough to cover the gigantic Ten-Tails, and manipulate them into pinching off pieces of the beast into Claw Grime.
- Removal of Claw Marks may be difficult, as Shikamaru Nara had to request Kawaki to use Sukunahikona to shrink them to unusable sizes.
