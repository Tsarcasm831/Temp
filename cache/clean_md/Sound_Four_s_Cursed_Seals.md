## Summary
Each member of the Sound Four uses a cursed seal. Their seals, however, are not as powerful as the Heaven and Earth seals, although they have similar end results.

## Counters / Defenses
- Jirobo stated that utilising the second stage of the Cursed Seal makes them ten times more powerful than before.
- However, Sakon comments that after using their cursed seal's second level and coming out of it, they lose a lot of energy.
- Later, in Part II of the anime, it was revealed that Orochimaru enhanced the power of their cursed seals, giving them the ability to use the Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover, a technique capable of trapping the souls of the user and the victim within an untraceable barrier, to fight with little to no interference.

- Tayuya's cursed seal consists of three hooks, similar to a triskelion on the back of her neck.
- When the second level of her seal is active, her hair grows longer, she grows five oddly-placed horns on her head, slightly resembling a crown, and her skin turns dark brown.
- Sakon and Ukon Curse Mark 2.png|Sakon and Ukons' cursed seal; second level.
- Sakon and Ukon both have the same type of cursed seal, which consists of three circular dots placed like a triangular shape on their foreheads.
- When the second level of their seals are active, they resemble goblins with red skin, longer hair, a single horn (on opposite sides for each brother), and can grow black armour from their bodies (from the side where they separate).

## Notes
- The technique however, would result in the user's death.
- In the cases of the Sound Four, who were reincarnated, they were able to survive the usage of this technique, though their souls returned to the Pure Land when the barrier was broken.
- However, the pattern that spreads during its first state are like chains of triangular arrows.
- He most greatly resembles an ogre in this form.
- He claims his strength increases ten times, to the point where he can single-handedly lift a gigantic Chōji Akimichi.
- He becomes more spider-like, almost oni-like in appearance in this form.
- By opening the third eye on his forehead, his accuracy increases to the point of pinpointing Neji Hyūga’s Byakugan blind spot from a distance of over 50 metres.
- This increase in strength and precision allowed him to use the destructive archery technique, Spider War Bow: Terrible Split.
- The horns grow when she exerts herself.
- Her strength increases, to the point of breaking free of the Shadow Imitation Technique.
- They can also extend their fusing abilities to someone other than each other, and tear their opponents apart on a cellular level.
