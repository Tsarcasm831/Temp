- Users: Sasori, Kankur≈ç~game
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
To begin this technique, Sasori removes one summoning scroll from his back. He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll.

## Usage
- As even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the Puppet Technique.
- Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets.

## Drawbacks
- As with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special poison, which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.

## Notes
- From the scroll, more than a hundred puppets wearing red cloaks emerge.
- Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response.
- However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.
- Sasori stated that he brought down an entire country (the Land of This in the anime) with this technique.
- Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with Chiyo and Sakura Haruno, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets.
- While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents.
- In the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside Hiruko.
