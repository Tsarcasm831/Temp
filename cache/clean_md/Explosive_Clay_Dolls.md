## Summary
Deidara releases a glob of explosive clay from both his hands that he forms into deformed human-like figures. Deidara then uses them to fight his opponent in close combat.

## Usage
- Their body structure allows them to extend their body parts and not be sliced by normal means, however, a lightning-infused chop or sword will suffice.

## Notes
- If a clay figure loses a body part, Deidara can simply attach a clay cord to it and form another clay figure.
- As the clay figures are made from explosive clay, Deidara can also detonate them at any moment while they are fighting the opponent.
- * Until sufficiently cut down, these clay minions did not adhere to Deidara's usual aesthetic designs, appearing misshapen and clumsy.
