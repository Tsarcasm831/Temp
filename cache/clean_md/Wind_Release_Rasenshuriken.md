## Summary
The Wind Release: Rasenshuriken is a shuriken-shaped variant of the Wind Release: Rasengan. Like that technique, Naruto typically has the help of two shadow clones in the Rasenshuriken's formation: he provides the chakra, one clone helps keep the chakra contained, and the second clone adds his wind nature.

## Counters / Defenses
- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Hiruko tries to absorb this technique, but was unable to combine the peak-levels of shape and nature transformation, like Naruto did at first.

## Drawbacks
- Its four points are very sharp, enough to cut through rock and disintegrate most of Pain's Human Path.
- It, however, poses enough risk for Tsunade to demand it never be used again.

## Notes
- It is the completed version of the Wind Release: Rasengan, with four large points around the central Rasengan core, giving the appearance of a fūma shuriken.
- It also gives off a loud screeching noise.
- By the time of The Last: Naruto the Movie , Naruto is able to create Rasenshuriken without aid and is able to remotely guide it.
- The Rasenshuriken requires a great deal of chakra to perform.
- Naruto has been shown creating as many as three Rasenshuriken on his own before tiring out.
- While in Sage Mode, he can create two Rasenshuriken per transformation.
- After the second, he must re-enter Sage Mode in order to be able to create additional Rasenshuriken.
- However, after improving his Sage Mode he's able to use three at a single time (five in the anime), and while in his Kurama Mode or Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he can use the Rasenshuriken an unlimited number of times.
- The technique is extremely heavy, as Fukasaku was surprised Naruto could throw the highly dense chakra, even in Sage Mode.
- After travelling a certain distance or colliding with a target that it can't slice through, the central sphere of the Rasenshuriken detonates, producing a vortex of wind in the immediate area.
- Within this vortex, countless microscopic wind blades are created, so many that even the Sharingan can't count them all.
- The wind blades pierce every cell in the body, disconnecting them from the Chakra circulatory system and so preventing them from providing their physical energy to the chakra-creation process.
- Because of this, the target loses their ability to create and mould chakra, damage which cannot be healed by medical ninjutsu.
- Tsunade likens the damage to poison, and warns that if the damage is great enough, those affected by it won't be able to use jutsu again.
- The Rasenshuriken causes cellular damage not only to his targets, but to the arm Naruto holds the Rasenshuriken with, though the damage isn't quite as severe.
- Naruto is able to overcome these flaws by learning senjutsu.
- By infusing the Rasenshuriken with senjutsu chakra, its shape is maintained after formation, meaning that he can use it as a projectile and, as a result, that he no longer needs to worry about damaging himself.
- When thrown, the Rasenshuriken travels very quickly, enough to cross the crater of Chibaku Tensei in under a second.
- Once thrown, Naruto can remotely expand the Rasenshuriken to either compensate for imprecise aim or to catch dodging targets, though its speed is great enough that this is rarely necessary.
- He enjoys similar benefits while using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, where he can use his chakra arms to guide the Rasenshuriken to its target while he remains at a safe distance.
- Moreover, he can use these chakra arms in place of the usual shadow clones.
- Naruto eventually starts making the Rasenshuriken a template for other jutsu, just as he does with the regular Rasengan.
- Like the Rasengan, some of the simpler modifications he makes to the Rasenshuriken are by using multiple simultaneously or making them larger (or even smaller).
- In place of the Rasengan he uses for the centre of the Rasenshuriken, he can use Tailed Beast Balls or Truth-Seeking Balls that will create significantly larger explosions upon detonation.
- He can also apply other natures to the Rasenshuriken, as he does with the Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken.
- * Like the Rasengan, the Rasenshuriken's colour is depicted inconsistently in the series because Masashi Kishimoto has yet to decide upon a colour for the technique.
- It is most often depicted as being a bluish-white, but different promotional and supplementary material have also shown it as red or orange with no obvious pattern.
- The sphere begins forming in his hand, but it becomes unstable and disperses, backfiring on him.
- * In certain games, when the senjutsu version of the Rasenshuriken is thrown, it will hit and carry its target into the air before exploding.
- This version is referred to as the .
