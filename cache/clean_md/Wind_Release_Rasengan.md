## Summary
The Wind Release: Rasengan is an original technique created by Naruto Uzumaki. He is eventually able to overcome this obstacle by using shadow clones: he provides the chakra, one shadow clone shapes the chakra into a sphere, and a second infuses the sphere with wind.

## Usage
- When it hits its target, it creates a shockwave of wind away from Naruto.

## Notes
- The end product becomes the Wind Release: Rasengan.
- and with additional experience users can perform it without any shadow clones at all.
- Naruto's version appears largely identical to a standard Rasengan, but is stronger, and capable of being thrown.
- When used in combination with Water Release, its wind nature can expand the other jutsu's coverage area.
- Konohamaru's usage is surrounded by an aura and generates a large current of air, with its strength being capable of destroying a hill from a distance.
- In the anime, Naruto instead uses "Rasengan: Flash".
