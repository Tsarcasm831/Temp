## Quick Facts

- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Kiba Inuzuka~~with~Akamaru, Akamaru~~with~Kiba Inuzuka
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
This technique is a specialty of the Inuzuka clan. The Inuzuka and their ninken companion perform the Combination Transformation to take the shared form of a two-headed wolf.

## Notes
- Because of the transformation's size, its strong claws, and its two sets of fangs, its standard attacks are quite powerful.
- This is especially true of any other jutsu performed while using this form, which are far more destructive than what the Inuzuka or the ninken are ordinarily capable of.
- These attacks and jutsu are most often performed against targets that have been cornered, fitting their wolf form.
- * In Greek mythology, Orthrus is a two-headed dog and brother of Cerberus.
