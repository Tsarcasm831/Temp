## Summary
While controlling the body of Boruto Uzumaki, Momoshiki cloaks himself in an aura of deep blue chakra and flies high into the sky, momentarily vanishing from view. He then arcs back down and dives toward his opponent at high speed while forming a Rasengan in his right palm, striking them with it at the moment of impact.
