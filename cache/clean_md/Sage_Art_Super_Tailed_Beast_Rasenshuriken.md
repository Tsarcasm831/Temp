## Summary
This is an "ultimate technique" created by Naruto Uzumaki using the power given to him by the Sage of Six Paths. Naruto and eight of his shadow clones each form a Rasenshuriken that's been imbued with the unique chakra of a different tailed beast; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra Kaguya Ōtsutsuki would be weak to.

## Notes
- Jin no Sho describes this as, "the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time."

The exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:
#The Rasenshuriken for Shukaku has a similar appearance to the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan, which uses magnetized sand.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Matatabi appears to consist of the same blue fire that Matatabi's body is composed of.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Isobu is seemingly formed out of water.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Son Gokū appears to be the Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Kokuō seems to be emitting steam, which Kokuō's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Saiken resembles a bubbly gas.
- In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for Wisdom Wolf Decay.
- In the anime, it appears more analogous to the Soap Bubble Ninjutsu used by Saiken's jinchūriki.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Chōmei has no obvious source in either the manga or anime.
- Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 identifies it as being composed of Scale Powder.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Gyūki is seemingly made of ink, which Gyūki's jinchūriki have been shown to be able to produce.
- #The Rasenshuriken for Kurama appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.
- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , both known variations of the Lava Release are implied to be present separately within this technique.
