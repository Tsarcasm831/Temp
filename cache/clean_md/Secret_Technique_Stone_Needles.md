## Summary
This technique makes use of the user's chakra as a paralysing agent. The user throws kunai with strings attached at the opponent.

## Counters / Defenses
- However, against those who can absorb chakra, this technique could backfire as the target may simply steal chakra from the user, while exhibiting immunity to the paralysis, as Kisame demonstrated.

## Drawbacks
- The pressure points used in acupuncture are said to be able to inflict great pain, paralysis, and even death, hence this technique's name.

## Notes
- Once the enemy is hit, chakra is ran through the string to paralyse them, which will serve to either incapacitate or allow the user to attack.
- This offensive use has long been featured in fiction as an unorthodox, but elegant fighting method.
- Haku, for example, uses this to great effect.
- * In Naruto Mobile , Aoba uses this technique in conjunction with Scattering Thousand Crows Technique.
- He directs the crows towards the enemy and they obscure their vision so that they do not notice Aoba attacking them.
