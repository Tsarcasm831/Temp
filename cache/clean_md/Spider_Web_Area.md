# Spider Web Area

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Kidōmaru
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
Kidōmaru spreads a network of "touch threads" throughout an area. Kidōmaru constantly sends his chakra along the threads, allowing him to sense anything that comes into contact with them; the threads are sensitive enough to even detect slight disturbances in the air.

## Usage
- The touch threads, being stronger than wire, can also be used to reel in those who've contacted them.

## Notes
- Because the threads appear no different than normal spiderwebs, they aren't likely to be noticed and thus are effective as an alert of approaching enemies.
