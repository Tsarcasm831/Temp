- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Urashiki Ōtsutsuki

## Summary
Prior to being struck by an attack, Urashiki activates his tomoe-less Rinnegan and causes it to glow blue. His body then disappears without warning, leaving behind ten glowing red orizuru, which slowly float to the ground before fading away.

## Notes
- Afterwards, Urashiki's chakra signature is completely untraceable, allowing him to escape elsewhere unnoticed.
- The exact nature of this technique is unclear, but upon observing it, Sasuke Uchiha believed that it does not involve slipping into another dimension.
