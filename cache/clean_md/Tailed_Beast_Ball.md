## Summary
The Tailed Beast Ball is the ultimate technique of a tailed beast, which can also be used by a jinchūriki while transformed. Users must gather and balance this chakra in their mouths, shape it into a sphere (or a conical shape in the case of the Ten-Tails), and then fire it at their target; Gyūki likens this to vomiting.

## Usage
- As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Obito Uchiha is able to form multiple Tailed Beast Balls at once via a tree he creates, each of which can fire in a different direction.

## Notes
- Most users fire their Tailed Beast Balls as-is, while others may consume the ball and fire it from their mouth as a beam, focusing the attack on a narrower area instead of letting it detonate all around upon impact.
- Gyūki is even shown doing something in between, not consuming its Tailed Beast Ball yet still firing it out in a wave.
- There is no limit to how much chakra can be put into a Tailed Beast Ball so long as the 8:2 ratio is maintained: Kurama has shown to be able to create a Tailed Beast Ball many times bigger than itself when using even a fraction of its chakra.
- Tailed Beasts can also combine their Tailed Beast Balls to form it into a very large one.
- Tailed Beast Balls are incredibly dense, so much so that despite being suspended in the air, they instantly crater the ground beneath the user due to their extreme weight.
- Despite how heavy they are, they move at an incredible rate once fired.
- When used by the Ten-Tails, the Tailed Beast Ball was able to cross several miles in only a few seconds.
- Tailed Beast Balls are very destructive, creating explosions that are visible from incredibly far away and that vaporize almost everything in the blast area.
- The extent of the damage is dependent upon how the ball is fired and how much chakra it has.
- Its "standard" size is enough to easily vaporize mountains.
- The power of the Tailed Beast Ball is shown to even dwarf islands, however, Kurama and Gyūki have been shown to cause immense damage, such that the devastation dwarfed entire mountain ranges and could be felt across the continent.
- Tailed Beast Balls are comparatively weaker if a jinchūriki uses one without entering their Tailed Beast Mode, yet it is still potent enough to represent a serious threat to people and infrastructure.
- Some jinchūriki are shown using Tailed Beast Balls in atypical ways.
- Naruto, when using his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, can form a Tailed Beast Ball with his hands, similar to how he makes the Rasengan.
- He can also add natural energy to his Tailed Beast Balls, increasing their power and potency, while also allowing them to be used against Truth-Seeking Balls.
- In the anime, Sora uses an entirely white Tailed Beast Ball while transformed under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra.
- Himawari Uzumaki is able to form a Tailed Beast Ball incredibly quickly from her mouth and hair which act like tails, making her resemble a miniature Kurama in her usage.
- Being incarnations of the Ten-Tails, the sentient God Trees have been shown to have the capability of using the Tailed Beast Ball.
- Unlike the tailed beasts and jinchūriki, Jura formed a Tailed Beast Ball from his right Rinnegan.

- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Gyūki performs a Lightning Release version of this technique.
- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , Saiken performs a variation of this technique utilising Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu.
- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Naruto and Sasuke perform a variation of this technique wherein the Tailed Beast Ball is coated with Sasuke's Amaterasu and the Tailed Beasts' specific chakra types are added to the ball.
- This was used against Madara Uchiha's gigantic Chibaku Tensei.
- Killer B observes that the process for forming a Rasengan is exactly the same as forming a Tailed Beast Ball, with its chakra rotation acting as a substitute for the tailed beast form.
- In the anime, it is formed from positive blue chakra and negative red chakra, and the completed ball is purple.
- In some instances, it is depicted taking on a red colour upon being fired.
- ** In J-Stars Victory VS , Naruto's Tailed Beast Ball uses the manga's colour scheme, but glows yellow upon being fired.
- * Shukaku is the only tailed beast not seen using a Tailed Beast Ball in the manga.
- However, it does so in an anime-only dream world created by the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
- * In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Orochimaru is capable of using a similar attack when using his Eight Branches Technique.
- * In the anime, one of the Infinite Tsukuyomi's dream worlds depicts the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path using this technique.
- * In Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze , Kido Tsumiki has access to the Tailed Beast Ball via the usage of his Tailed Beast Drug.
- However, while powerful, his Tailed Beast Ball is noted to be nowhere near as powerful as ones coming from a true Tailed Beast.
