# Secret Technique: Insect Cocoon

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden~Aburame Clan, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Shino Aburame
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This unique technique allows the user to accelerate the growth of their insects. As the user's body is already a hive of sorts for the insects, the user will encase themselves in an actual cocoon to further aid the insects.

## Notes
- This is an extremely useful move for Aburame clan members, since their attacks mainly focus on the usage of insects.
- However, using this in the midst of a battle can be potentially dangerous as it leaves the user static and vulnerable.
- As such when this technique is being employed, the user generally finds a safe location or otherwise can be guarded by their teammate.
