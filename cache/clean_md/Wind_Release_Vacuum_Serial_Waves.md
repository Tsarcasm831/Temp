## Summary
The user takes a deep breath and exhales several blades of wind at different angles, by rapidly moving their head in various directions. The power of this technique can be dramatically enhanced when utilised in conjunction with the effects of extreme suction, such as that generated by Baku, where the augmented attack proved effective enough to even slice through the defences of Sasuke's humanoid Susanoo.
