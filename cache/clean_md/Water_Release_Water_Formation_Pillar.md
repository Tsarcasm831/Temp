## Summary
A defensive technique where chakra kneaded inside the body is converted into water and then expelled from the mouth in a dense, curved torrent, near-instantaneously creating a circular barricade that can be used to intercept incoming attacks. In her battle against Madara Uchiha, Mei was able to use this to overpower and extinguish his Fire Release: Great Fire Destruction — a feat that would normally require many Water Release users working in tandem.
