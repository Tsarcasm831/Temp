# Delicate Illness Extraction Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Medical Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Sakura Haruno
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
When a person has been afflicted by a pathogen or toxin, this medical ninjutsu can be used to draw out the agent and heal the damage. The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra.

## Usage
- After the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed.
- This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control.

## Counters / Defenses
- Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision.

## Drawbacks
- The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work.

## Notes
- Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part.
- The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body.
- This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison.
- As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency.
- This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate.
- To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.
- This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery.
- Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin.
