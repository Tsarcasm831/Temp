## Summary
A larger scaled version of the Wood Release: Four-Pillar House Technique where instead of creating a single house, Yamato creates multiple houses at once. Because of the sheer volume of structures created with this technique, it appears to exhaust him rather quickly.

## Drawbacks
- * It should be noted that in the anime, these constructs emerged fully painted and with glass windows.
