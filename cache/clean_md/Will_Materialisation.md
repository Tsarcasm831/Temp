## Summary
This ability allows a user to materialise their itself into a physical form. In an attempt to retrieve the chakra bestowed upon her two sons, she imparted her will upon the God Tree and — along with all the people tethered to it — created what then became the Ten-Tails.

## Usage
- Created as a malleable construct, Black Zetsu is capable of controlling the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and taking possession of them.

## Counters / Defenses
- Immediately prior to being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki formulated a plan that would result in her eventual revival.
- This allowed Madara to remotely control Obito's actions using his chakra, as well as fire black rods out of his body as projectiles, though Obito was ultimately able to resist his control.

## Notes
- Titanic in size, she was able to use its power to fight her children for a length of months.
- To accomplish this, she created a sentient being known as Black Zetsu, which would spend centuries fulfilling her desire.
- Once the remnants of her chakra were finally reunited, Black Zetsu was able to revive her within a new host, Madara Uchiha.
- It was also capable of manipulating the husk of the Ten-Tails, extracting a number of White Zetsu from it.
- Moments prior to his death, he attempted to infuse his will into the right half of White Zetsu, seemingly creating Black Zetsu, which he referred to as a weaker version of himself; in actuality, Black Zetsu merely made it look like it was being created as part of its plan.
- Madara was actually able to impart his will into the black rod that emerged from the flowering tree he was attached to in his old age.
- Revealing it to Obito, Madara claimed that it was a physical manifestation of his will and that it should be used when performing the Six Paths Technique.
- On a later occasion, following his resurrection, Madara caused a number of these black rods to emerge from Obito's artificial right half, which became entirely coated in a black substance similar to Black Zetsu.
