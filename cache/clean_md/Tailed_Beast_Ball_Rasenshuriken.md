## Summary
With help from Kurama, Naruto converts his Truth-Seeking Ball into a Tailed Beast Ball, and adds wind-natured chakra to create the shuriken-like blades around it before hurling it at the target. The resulting explosion dwarfs that of a regular Tailed Beast Ball and can destroy multiple planetoid-like objects in one blast.

## Notes
- In the manga, he only had six Truth-Seeking Balls with which to create them.
