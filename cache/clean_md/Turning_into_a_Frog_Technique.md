## Summary
By touching the forehead of a target and then, according to a mental image the user forms, the target changes into a tree frog. This is mainly used for interrogating several prisoners of war.

## Notes
- Seeing their comrades changed into a frog before their eyes, the prisoners of war will cave in, becoming what could be described as a "frog chorus", sonorously chanting information.
- This terrifying technique will, without a doubt, make an "information leak" open up.
- The term "to turn into", written as "変える", is also pronounced "kaeru", which leads to this technique's interesting pronunciation, "Kaeru Kaeru no Jutsu".
