## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Cooperation Ninjutsu, Barrier Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Akaboshi, Benten, Chūshin, Nangō
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This technique has exactly the same effect as Infinite Embrace, but this version is much larger and stronger as it could completely subdue and incapacitate Naruto Uzumaki, despite him using the Nine-Tails' chakra. The Magaki Group puts their opponent in a barrier that pushes down on them, preventing them from escaping and draining their chakra.

## Notes
- The more effort place into the technique enhances its ability to subdue and drain chakra from the target.
