## Summary
The user utilises the ringing of bells to produce a sound wave that travels through the eardrum directly into the target's brain. This paralyses the victim while also causing them to hallucinate, seeing multiple images of the user, which makes it difficult for them to tell the real one from the illusions.

## Notes
- The user can then take advantage of this to easily attack the victim.
