## Summary
This is a collaboration technique whereby eight people simultaneously perform the Tiger hand seal, forming a large sealing formula with a jinchūriki at its centre. The formula then begins to glow and suppress the tailed beast's chakra.

## Notes
- Chiriku along with seven others attempted to use this technique to suppress the Tailed Beast Chakra's rage inducing influence over Sora, but Sora was able to easily break their formation using a chakra enhanced roar and thus prevent the technique's completion.
