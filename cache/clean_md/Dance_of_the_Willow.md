# Dance of the Willow

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Shikotsumyaku, Taijutsu,
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Kimimaro
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Kimimaro produces long, hardened bones from his body that can easily puncture opponents, dealing serious damage. There is no set way in which the bones are used for this "dance": T≈ç no Sho likens his movements to the branches of a willow, swaying in the wind.

## Counters / Defenses
- In keeping with this, Kimimaro's movements while using this technique are mostly evasive and his attacks are primarily parries and counters.

## Notes
- Kimimaro usually only uses bones sprouted from the palms of his hands, but if these aren't enough he can produce additional bones from his knees, elbows, and shoulders so that he can attack multiple targets at once.
