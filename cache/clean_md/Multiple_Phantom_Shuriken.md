# Multiple Phantom Shuriken

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu, Cooperation Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This technique is very similar in both execution and result to the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique. It is a cooperation ninjutsu where three users, after throwing shuriken at their target and forming the necessary hand seals, can create corporeal replicas of the shuriken â€” turning a small amount of shuriken to a large amount in an instant with which to bombard the enemy.

## Notes
- Unlike the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique, however, this technique makes no use of the Shadow Clone Technique.
