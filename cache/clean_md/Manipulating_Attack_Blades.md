## Summary
This technique allows the user to control multiple kunai - or a similar weapon - at once. By releasing chakra from the hand over an area, the user can freely manipulate any kunai within that area.

## Usage
- This allows the user to either attack opponents from their blindside or surround them with kunai, preventing them from escaping.

## Notes
- In Gaara Hiden , Amagi throws a volley of projectiles and then, as they near their target, uses chakra threads to manipulate them, steering the projectiles around the target's defenses and grouping them together for a more focused attack.
