## Summary
The Infinite Tsukuyomi is an extremely powerful genjutsu that traps the entire world in an illusion, enslaving the human and animal populations in a dream so that their chakra may be drawn upon by the God Tree. The exact method of achieving this varies from user to user: in the anime Kaguya Ōtsutsuki uses Yomotsu Hirasaka to create a portal to a dimension containing a moon; Obito Uchiha produces the Ten-Tails and transforms it into a construct of the God Tree, which has a Rinne Sharingan within the blooming flower at its top; Madara Uchiha, per his Eye of the Moon Plan, flies into the sky and reflects his own Rinne Sharingan off of the moon.

## Usage
- A Rinnegan user can block the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, saving themselves and those within their range from its control.
- * In the anime, Kankurō creates the ultimate puppet, which is a giant transforming robot.

## Counters / Defenses
- Should these be possessed by two different people, they must form the rat hand seal together in order to release the technique.

## Notes
- Once cast, the penetrating light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi shines across the world, bright enough to dispel the night for as long as it is active.
- All those who fall under its gaze are trapped in the genjutsu, with the Rinnegan's design appearing in their eyes to represent its influence.
- Victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are rendered immobile so long as they are under its effects, allowing them to easily be wrapped by the bark of the God Tree's roots using God: Nativity of a World of Trees.
- Over the course of years, humans connected to the tree in this manner are gradually drained of their life energy, personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into White Zetsu while at the same time, producing a new Chakra Fruit in the process.
- The user can also draw upon the chakra of those bound to the tree, causing it to erupt from the ground and enter their own body.
- In the anime, the technique seemed to need perfecting as Kaguya discovered in her first usage: most of those trapped in Infinite Tsukuyomi such as Haori died after being trapped in the genjutsu instead of being converted into White Zetsu.
- Certain individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
- The dead, such as those brought back with the Impure World Reincarnation, are impervious to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
- White Zetsu, Black Zetsu, and those whose body Black Zetsu coats are also unaffected.
- In fact, Rinnegan users, through the combination with the chakra of the nine tailed beasts, are the only ones capable of ending the Infinite Tsukuyomi and releasing those trapped within its dreams.
