## Summary
A capturing ninjutsu that is characteristic to Gaara. Using ordinary sand, a perfectly airtight space is created, in which the enemy is captured.

## Notes
- An enormous quantity of sand completely envelops the target from every direction and captures them.
- The speed, hardness, and scope of the sand depend on the amount of chakra poured into it.
- Gaara can fine-tune the sand's properties to the target's size and characteristics.
- No matter if the target is on the ground or flying in the air, it is almost impossible to escape from this technique.
- However, even if someone successfully escapes from it, Gaara can easily use one of his offensive techniques, like the Sand Binding Coffin, to immediately attack the target.
