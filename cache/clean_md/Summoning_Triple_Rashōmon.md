## Summary
The Summoning: Triple Rashōmon is an upgrade to the standard Summoning: Rashōmon, which — as its name suggests — summons not one, but three menacing Rashōmon. The technique requires two summoning seals to be completed, and these gates serve the same function as the single Rashōmon, but with triple the defence.

## Counters / Defenses
- The defensive capabilities of this technique are further boosted by the lack of hand seals required to perform this technique.

## Notes
- The first gate takes the attack head-on, the second reduces the attack's power and the third disperses the pressure, causing all attacks that come in contact with it to lose their power before they can be effective.
- The defensive capabilities of this technique was able to protect Orochimaru from dying from a Tailed Beast Ball, which he stated would have killed him had he taken that attack head on.
