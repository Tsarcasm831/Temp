## Summary
The Forbidden Individual Curse Tag is a juinjutsu utilised by Madara Uchiha. A direct strike to the heart appears to be able to remove the seal — albeit risking one's life in the process.

## Counters / Defenses
- According to Obito Uchiha, the cursed seal also interfered with him becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki.
- * While this seal prevented Obito from becoming a jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, no such hindrance existed for Rin becoming one for Isobu.

## Notes
- * In the manga, the tag is black, with a Rinnegan-like symbol on it, while in the anime, it is white, with a red, white, and teal symbol.
