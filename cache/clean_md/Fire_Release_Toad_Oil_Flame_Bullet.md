## Summary
This is a cooperation ninjutsu performed by a toad and a fire user who have achieved mental and physical harmony with each other. The toad (specifically a large toad such as Gamabunta) uses its large lung capacity to spray toad oil from its mouth at a target.

## Notes
- The fire user then ignites the oil, increasing the attack's range and power; Jiraiya uses Fire Release: Flame Bullet for this purpose.
- The resulting cloud of fire is great enough that it forces Manda to shed its skin to escape.
