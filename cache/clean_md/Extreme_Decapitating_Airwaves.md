# Extreme Decapitating Airwaves

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Zaku Abumi
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
This is a stronger version of Decapitating Airwaves, having greater power, range, and coverage angle. Using a large amount of chakra, Zaku Abumi emits a high-pressured mixture of sound waves and airwaves from the holes in the palms of his hands into the area ahead of him.

## Notes
- It momentarily blocks visibility as the air and sound quickly travel forwards, carving up the ground and reducing everything in its path to dust.
- The sheer destructiveness of this technique prevents it from being used in quick succession, as it places a great burden on Zaku's arms.
