- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Guren
- Media: Anime

## Summary
After planting red crystal seeds, Guren can cause them to bloom at will. These flower-like constructs will rapidly grow and into a massive barrier in order to trap whatever is within its perimeter.

## Notes
- Enemies trapped inside hindered by the labyrinth's reflective nature as it can generate mirror images of the routes, paths, and other details within its confines, confusing and disorienting them.
- It is even capable of confusing the Byakugan.
- Until it is broken, the barrier cannot be discerned from within.
- Because of the crystal's stable molecular structure, a simple attack focused at one point is rendered useless, and its wide surface will disperse the force of wide range attacks, reducing their effectiveness.
- To overcome this technique, an attack that has impact force both wide and powerful is required to smash through it from the outside.
