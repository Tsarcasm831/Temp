## Summary
After Gaara scatters and compresses numerous sand particles into bullet-like projectiles, Shukaku expels a giant gust of wind from its stomach, with the impact of a bomb to increase the force of the bullets, creating a large-scale sandstorm. This attack is powerful enough to pierce through flesh with ease, and is difficult to dodge, due to the technique's speed and range.

## Counters / Defenses
- An additional benefit of this attack is that it pushes the target away from the user and Gaara can then use any of the sand left in his target's bloodstream to immobilise or manipulate them, leaving them vulnerable to follow up attacks.
