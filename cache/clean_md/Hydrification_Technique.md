This jutsu, a hallmark of the Hōzuki clan, allows the user to liquefy any part of their body at will, from the hair on their head to the muscles in their arms. but it's not clear if this same mixture is used by other members.

## Counters / Defenses
- If a Hōzuki is captured and placed inside a sealed container, they will be unable to move or escape.

## Notes
- When the user is struck by a physical attack, the impacted area becomes liquid, causing the attack to pass through them and leave them unharmed.
- The user then solidifies back into their original form.
- They can pump water into their muscles to increase their strength, shoot water from their fingers as an attack, or use their bodies to douse targets.
