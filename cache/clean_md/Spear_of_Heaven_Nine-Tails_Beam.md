## Summary
After bathing in Ama no Hoko, the Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone's abilities were magnified and it could fire powerful purplish-orange chakra beams from its dragon/snake-like heads. These beams were powerful enough to cut through solid rock and even damage Naruto despite the latter being almost completely transformed into Kurama.
