## Summary
Guren places her hand on a surface, creating a long stream of sharp blue crystals to bind and pierce a target. In winter, the lake's surface freezes over, but because of a natural hot spring under the lake, the lower waters remain warm and circulating.

## Notes
- This causes pressure ridges to appear on the ice, reaching heights of 30 centimetres or more.
- Local belief holds that these ridges are formed by gods crossing the lake to visit the various buildings of the twelve centuries old Suwa Grand Shrine.
