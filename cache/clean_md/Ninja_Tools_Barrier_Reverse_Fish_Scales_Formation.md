## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Cooperation Ninjutsu, Kenjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Long
- Users: Hōki (Takumi), Kujaku, Ryūgan
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This is a technique used by the Four Celestial Symbols Men. Devised to counter Gaara's sand, the formation draws upon their weapons (Weaknessless Soaring Shortswords, Garian Sword and Hōki's unnamed fire-shooting sword), arranged in a triangle with Gaara at the centre.

## Notes
- The three members will use three underground waterways to connect their formation, which will converge under their target.
- With their weapons charged with their chakra, they will then activate the technique, sending a surge of power through the waterways to the central target.
- This will cause a water dragon to rise from the ground and envelop Gaara, soaking his sand and making it become much heavier.
- This causes it to clump and makes it near impossible to utilise.
