## Summary
The Strength of a Hundred Seal is a jutsu from the Sage of Six Paths era, that requires extremely delicate chakra control. When released, the seal will either spread across the user's face or wrap around their entire body.

## Usage
- It represents the third eye which allows one to see past the mundane world and into the divine world.

## Counters / Defenses
- The seal will permanently remain in the centre of the user's forehead, presumably so that the user can keep on benefiting from its effects.
- This seal is also symbiotically linked to the summon Katsuyu, to either perform widespread healing of people, or communicating with the slug over long distances.
- That is to say: the power of the techniques used by Katsuyu, is directly proportional to the reserves of the seal.
- By releasing the power of their seals, Tsunade and Sakura were able to combine its power with the Creation Rebirth technique in order to gain access to the Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique.
- While the Strength of a Hundred Seal seems to be modelled after this in terms of appearance, it is currently unknown if hers is also a Strength of a Hundred Seal.
- * In the chapters published in Shōnen Jump , the seal was initially identified as .
- * Tsunade also uses a portion of the seal's chakra to maintain her youthful appearance.
- * Due to similar appearances, Sarada Uchiha speculates there exists a connection between this seal and Kāma.

## Notes
- The stored chakra is then released into their body, greatly amplifying the power of their techniques.
- * Mito Uzumaki had a similar marking on her forehead.
- It was corrected in the tankōbon version.
- ** In the anime, Tsunade stated that because of the delicate nature of building up chakra required for this technique, a person is substantially drained of normal reserves of chakra, making it dangerous for one to perform surgery or battle.
- Sakura, however, found a way to divert a small portion of that built-up chakra back into her normal reserves.
- * Mitsuki claims Orochimaru has researched it, finding it to have a long and poorly understood history.
