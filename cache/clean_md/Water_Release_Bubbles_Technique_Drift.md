# Water Release: Bubbles Technique â€” Drift

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Water Release
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Utakata
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
Utakata creates a single, particularly large bubble with his bubble pipe and quickly jumps inside. Under his command, the bubble will take him wherever he wishes.

## Drawbacks
- It's seemingly very capable of both travelling very long distances and floating rather high into the air with no apparent risk of popping.

## Notes
- Utakata can also make the bubble camouflage to hide from anyone who's after him.
- Utakata is also able to take people with him via this technique.
- Smaller bubbles were seen floating casually alongside it, whereas the first time it was shown, it was just the one bubble.
- Upon bursting the bubble to get out of it, Utakata can use it do damage nearby opponents.
- * In Naruto Mobile , Yurui uses a similar ability, encasing the opponent in a huge bubble of bubblegum, inside which he floats above the ground, although not as high as Utakata is capable of.
- Yurui's bubble also explodes when necessary.
