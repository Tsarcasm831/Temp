## Summary
By utilising the Gunbai Uchiwa to block an incoming attack, the user nullifies the effects of the attack by converting the incoming chakra into Wind nature transformation, which is then reflected. As this reflection of an attack occurs both suddenly and unexpectedly, the reflected attack can prove difficult for opponents to evade.
