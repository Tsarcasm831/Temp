## Summary
The user places two shuriken together and throws them both at a target simultaneously; the larger the shuriken that are thrown, the greater the necessary skill. The goal is for targets to focus their attention on whichever of the two shuriken is on top, not noticing the second shuriken travelling below it.

## Counters / Defenses
- Ideally, targets will dodge the upper shuriken in such a way that they are left unable to dodge the second.

## Notes
- If targets do at any point realise there's a second shuriken, the technique is rendered ineffective.
- Additionally, this technique does not require a literal shuriken: the same principles can be applied to the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken.
