## Summary
A versatile technique where the user can produce sharp wooden spikes from their body to either fashion short-range weapons akin to a makeshift sword, or use them as projectiles, where the branches' growth can be triggered remotely, skewering the enemy as a result. Obito was able to channel this technique through the Ten-Tails' tails after he and Madara Uchiha strengthened their control over the beast by connecting to it using Hashirama Senju's DNA.

## Notes
- It involves cutting off a piece of a plant, usually the stem or root, which is then put in an appropriate medium.
- If done properly, the cut piece will grow into a new plant, genetically identical to the plant it was cut from.
- * When this technique was first performed by Obito, various black receivers were scattered throughout the growth of branches that extended from his right side.
- However, upon deactivating his Mangeky≈ç Sharingan and the Wood Release Technique, the rods vanished with them.
