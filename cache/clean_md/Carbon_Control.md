## Summary
This jutsu, allows the user to freely manipulate carbon. For external sources, the user is able to remotely control the said carbon, shaping it into a myriad of shapes, and levitate it freely.

## Usage
- Alternately, the user can manipulate, and fine-tune their control over the carbon within their own body, and rearrange the molecular-bonds between them.
- When utilising this internal and external nature of this technique on oneself, it produces a large armour that encases the user.

## Notes
- Upon which, the user can manipulate the cluster of carbon in a myriad of formations and launch them as a barrage of speeding projectiles that even the Sharingan has difficulty following.
- The user can also increase the size of the projectiles, strengthening to the point that their sheer force can plough through an Iron Sand Wall.
- In doing this, the user's body will take on a dark reflective state akin to metal.
- In this state, the user's body becomes super dense, as hard as diamond, granting them immense physical strength and becomes impervious to nearly any form of damage.
- This ability can also be used on any isolated part of the body or their entire being.
- In this state, it maximises the user's strength and resilience of the carbon, showing by it shining like diamonds.
