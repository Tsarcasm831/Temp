- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Bunpuku, Hōichi
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
With the help of a musical instrument and a fūinjutsu formula on their chest, the user produces a stream of chakra that forms into many purple-coloured chains that are launched from the formula into the target. The chains move very fast, able to bypass Gaara's Shield of Sand, which is known for its speed.

## Counters / Defenses
- The technique can be countered.
- If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them.
- Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.

## Drawbacks
- The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinchūriki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinchūriki's immobilisation and causing them pain.
- There is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however.

## Notes
- Once latched on to the target's body and chakra network, the chains will use the tenketsu located at the navel to reach their way to the tailed beast and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the jinchūriki.
- Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock.
- However, if another jinchūriki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.
- Techniques that suppress chakra absorption such as a cocoon made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained.
- The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by closing the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.
