## Summary
This technique is the second part of Gaara's "Absolute Defence", his Shield of Sand being the first part. As the name implies, Gaara covers his body in a layer of sand, wearing it like armour.

## Counters / Defenses
- Although it defends him from attacks that bypass his Shield of Sand, maintaining it consumes a great deal of chakra.
- Furthermore, it does not activate automatically like the Shield of Sand does (instead relying on Gaara to apply when needed), nor is it as resilient;
