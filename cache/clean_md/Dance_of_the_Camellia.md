## Summary
With his Shikotsumyaku, Kimimaro pulls from his body a bone, such as an upper arm bone, that he's modified to use as a sword. With it he repeatedly stabs at his target, doing so rapidly enough to create the appearance of afterimages.

## Counters / Defenses
- Although targets may be able to dodge Kimimaro's attacks for a time, they will eventually be unable to keep up with the constant and "chaotic" strikes, giving Kimimaro the opening he needs to finally stab and kill them.

## Notes
- Each stab is directed at a slightly different part of the target, from a slightly different angle, and with slightly different regularity, making it difficult to predict each strike.
