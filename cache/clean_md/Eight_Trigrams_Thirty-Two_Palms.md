## Summary
The Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms is a manoeuvre of the Gentle Fist fighting style. It is essentially a halved version of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms, but seems to be no less effective.

## Usage
- This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through thirty-two chakra points of an opponent's chakra pathway system.

## Notes
- This eliminates their ability to use chakra for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move.
- Once someone is within range of her field of divination, Hinata assumes her Gentle Fist stance and begins to deliver her attack:
* First, two consecutive strikes to make two.
- * Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.
- * Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.
- * Fourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.
- * Fifth, another sixteen consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of thirty-two.
