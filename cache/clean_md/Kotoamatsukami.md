## Summary
Kotoamatsukami is the signature dōjutsu of Shisui Uchiha's two Mangekyō Sharingan, which casts a powerful yet subtle mind-controlling genjutsu on a target. As a testament to its power, it was strong enough to negate Kabuto Yakushi's control over a reincarnated Itachi Uchiha, despite the former's binding being considered near-absolute.

## Usage
- * During the Five Kage Summit, the Fifth Mizukage commented that she could not help but conclude that there was a connection between this technique and the power that controlled Yagura Karatachi, the Fourth Mizukage.

## Counters / Defenses
- The technique was instead used on Itachi himself, after being reincarnated and inadvertently using his Mangekyō Sharingan when encountering Naruto during the Fourth Shinobi World War.

## Notes
- After having the crow cast the technique, Itachi noted that the dōjutsu required at least a decade before it could be used again.
- This period can be drastically reduced through the possession of Hashirama Senju's chakra, even for a non-Uchiha transplantee, as observed by Danzō Shimura's use.
- Noted as Shisui Uchiha's ultimate technique, it was highly coveted by Danzō, who later stole Shisui's right eye and had it implanted into his own right eye-socket to gain access to this dōjutsu.
- Later, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi Uchiha, who implanted it into the eye-socket of one of his crows.
- This crow was later forcibly stored inside Naruto Uzumaki and rigged to emerge only in response to confronting Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan.
- Upon activation, Itachi rigged the eye itself so that the genjutsu would give the order " protect Konoha " to whoever was affected by it.
- Itachi intended this to be used on his brother, in the eventuality that he turned against the village and assumed that he would have transplanted his eyes in order to obtain an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan by then.
