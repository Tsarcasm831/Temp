## Summary
A technique that transforms the earth surrounding the user into a fluid, allowing them to close in on the enemy with high speed by swimming underground. Since being under the ground is a blind spot, the target has no warning; allowing the user to launch a surprise attack.

## Notes
- By using this technique in conjunction with a weapon, it also gains great effect as an "assault ninjutsu".
- Kisame combines this with Samehada, allowing it to protrude from the ground, like a shark's dorsal fin.
