## Summary
The user creates a swamp by changing the ground beneath a target into mud, which the target sinks into. The mud is infused with chakra to make it sticky, ensnaring the target and preventing escape.

## Notes
- The size and depth of the swamp are determined by the user's skill and the amount of chakra used; ideally it will be made large enough for targets to become completely submerged.
- It is most effective when used against multiple and/or particularly large targets.
