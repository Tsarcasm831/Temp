## Summary
Amenotejikara is a space–time ninjutsu used by Sasuke Uchiha through the power of his Rinnegan, which was entrusted to him by the Sage of Six Paths. By shifting to another space during combat, Sasuke can avoid his opponent's techniques in an instant, and by swapping places with a weapon, such as his sword, he can leave behind a trap for an approaching enemy.

## Usage
- This allows him to transport a weapon into his hand, or to project one of his techniques, such as the Chidori, to a remote location.

## Counters / Defenses
- Only one time did he transport another person with thin air, and that was when he teleported Madara between himself and Naruto in an attempt to seal him as the Ten-Tails jinchūriki.
- * Despite being a space–time ninjutsu rather than accelerated movement, Naruto Uzumaki once described this technique as being similar to the Body Flicker Technique.

## Drawbacks
- Sasuke can also use this technique to escape from restraints and bind an opponent in his place, or to discard any foreign weapons embedded in his body.
- Upon first obtaining his Rinnegan, Sasuke had to wait for his eye to recharge after using this technique several times in quick succession, and further overuse would cause his eye to bleed.

## Notes
- Despite this technique stemming from his Rinnegan, Sasuke does not actually need to be looking at an object in order to swap places with it.
- Sasuke can also target other objects and individuals with this technique in order to shift them to another space in his surroundings.
- However, the opponent must be within a certain range of him for this to take effect, and with sufficient speed, it is possible to escape this technique's range before it can be activated.
- While storing the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, Sasuke demonstrated the ability to shift both himself and his Susanoo behind Naruto Uzumaki, who was a considerable distance away.
- In adulthood, Sasuke is able to use this technique even while his Rinnegan's ocular power is diminished due to using its other abilities.
- The technique's workings may be derived from the Iwato dance of the Sada Shrine; after Ame-no-tajikarao opens the cave and Amaterasu emerges, he takes her place inside the cave.
