## Summary
The Chidori is a high concentration of lightning chakra channelled around the user's hand. He intended for the Chidori to be a weapon used only to protect friends and loved ones.

## Usage
- To perform, the user first gathers lightning to their hand; the high concentration of electricity produces a sound reminiscent of many birds chirping, hence the name.
- Hidari despite having a pair of Rinnegan finds using the jutsu hard to control, and believes the Sharingan is needed to master it.
- The Chidori requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, placing a limit on how many times it can be used per day.

|When imbued with the Six Paths Power, Sasuke's Chidori can be used to damage the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, whose body is otherwise impervious to standard ninjutsu.

## Counters / Defenses
- However, a user of the Sharingan can overcome these drawbacks due to its heightened visual perception preventing the tunnel vision from occurring and its predictive capabilities making it easier for the user to avoid counterattacks.
- If accessed in his first state of the Cursed Seal, the Chidori is normally coloured purple instead in most forms of media.
- 4 and Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2 ), Sasuke in his Cursed Seal of Heaven state (both level 1 and 2) often has the ability to perform both the normal version of his Chidori and its Cursed Seal version as separate techniques.
- ** However, in Jump Super Stars , despite using the Cursed Seal Chidori in his State 2 form for his Battle 7 Koma, Sasuke's Chidori is coloured purple akin to the State 1 version instead of dark-white.

## Notes
- The lightning chakra has been shown on occasions to damage the user's hand, peeling the skin and causing it to smoulder slightly, but this does not appear to actually be debilitating.
- Once the chakra is gathered, users charge at their target and thrust the Chidori into them, piercing them and typically causing fatal damage.
- Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it's used makes it useful for assassinations.
- Kakashi's skill with the Chidori eventually became so good that he was able to split a bolt of lightning with it, earning his Chidori the name "Lightning Cutter".
- In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day and Sasuke Uchiha can use it twice per day under his own power.
- Both increase their limits to an unspecified number in Part II.
- During Part II, Sasuke demonstrates several variations of the Chidori that have been given shape transformation, such as Chidori Senbon and Chidori Sharp Spear, both of which allow him to attack at a longer range than the Chidori is capable of.
