## Summary
This technique changes earth into fine sand by channelling chakra into it, allowing the user to dig through it like a mole. This effect goes around the body (not just the hands), making it just large enough for a person to move through.

## Notes
- The user can pinpoint where they are, despite being underground, by sensing the magnetic forces.
- They can also sense what is happening on the surface and use that information to launch a surprise attack on the enemy.
- One can also hide deep in the ground, escaping to a depth where the enemy can't reach.
- It also appears that after digging, the ground can be returned to its original state, leaving no trace of where the user entered the earth.
- When combined with clone techniques, the user can use the clone to lure their enemies into a trap or false sense of security before launching a surprise attack from below.
