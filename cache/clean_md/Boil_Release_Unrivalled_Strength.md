## Summary
Boil Release: Unrivalled Strength is a ninjutsu fighting style used by Kokuō and its jinchūriki. The pressure resulting from this emitted steam can then be used to increase the force behind physical attacks, giving the user immense strength.

## Notes
- The exact amount of force produced is proportional to the quantity of steam released, as the greater the volume of steam utilised, the larger the pressure that can be built up.
- On releasing the pressure, not only is the user's strength enhanced, but their speed increased as well.
- The armour contains a furnace in its back, where steam is produced.
- The steam can be built up within the armour for a greater release, allowing just a simple kick to violently send an opponent reeling a great distance away.
