## Summary
The user moulds water into the shape of a dragon, which they then direct at a target. The water crashes upon the target, dealing significant physical damage.

## Usage
- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie , when Shizuku was under the influence of medically altered chakra, she was able to control the water dragon to seek out her targets from a great distance.

## Notes
- Ideally, users will use pre-existing bodies of water for this technique, but sufficiently skilled users can instead create the water themselves, spitting the dragon from their mouths.
- The more talented the user, the greater the amount of water that the dragon can be made from.
