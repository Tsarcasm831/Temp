## Summary
While focusing their chakra into their sword while still sheathed, the user performs a Batt≈çjutsu strike. From this, the user unleashes a powerful shockwave which becomes a massive tornado surrounding them, repelling everything in the area near the user.

## Usage
- Finally, the technique is also potentially dangerous to the user, as loss of control can potentially cause as much harm to the user as all other targets around them.

## Drawbacks
- Powerful as the technique is, it is not without drawbacks.

## Notes
- It takes time and focus to unleash the technique.
- It is also very chakra-taxing, making it only usable once in a given day.
