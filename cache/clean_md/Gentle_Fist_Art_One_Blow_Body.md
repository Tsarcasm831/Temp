## Summary
A technique born from their innate ability to expel chakra from every tenketsu on their body, a member of the Hy큰ga clan can hit their opponent with a blast of chakra that will send them flying away from the user. It was also shown that this technique can be used with pin-point accuracy to target the weak point of a technique exemplified when Neji Hy큰ga was trapped by Kisame Hoshigaki's Water Prison Technique, and was able to dispel it.
