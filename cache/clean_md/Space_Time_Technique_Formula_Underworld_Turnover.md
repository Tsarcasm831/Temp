## Summary
The Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover was a technique designed by Orochimaru for the sole purpose of revenge. It was utilised by the reincarnated Sound Four releasing their hatred within their cursed seals.

## Notes
- The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier.
- Sensor ninja and even the Byakugan cannot sense and see through this technique respectively.
- The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops.
- To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra.
- Inoichi Yamanaka likens this to a genjutsu cancel.
- Inside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know.
- Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end.
- As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die.
- However, it sacrifices the lives of the users so the targets can be trapped and the users' malice is not blocked by the barrier so a ninja who can sense ill will can locate the barrier and break it, freeing the souls trapped within, while the users' disappears.
