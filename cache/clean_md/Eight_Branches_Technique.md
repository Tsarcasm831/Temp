## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Defensive, Supplementary
- Users: Orochimaru

## Summary
This is Orochimaru's greatest and strongest snake-related technique. Using the "power of reincarnation" possessed by the White Snake as an intermediary, he can transform into a giant white serpent with eight heads and eight tails.

## Notes
- The serpent boasts a giant body, even larger than that of Manda, who was feared as the "strongest colossal serpent".
- Just by crawling on the scales of its abdomen it was able to trample the Uchiha hideout, and could destroy most things without difficulty.
- This technique transcends the "Snake", and becomes like a "Dragon God".
