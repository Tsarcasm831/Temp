## Summary
The user creates a rope with lava converted into a rubber-like material. It can be used to quickly withdraw an ally from the attack line, being more efficient when combined with a distraction.

## Notes
- * In this game, Dodai also uses this technique for attacks in two variations.
- In the first case, he swings a double rope with force like a whip, striking the opponent with lashings that are so strong that they split the ground under his feet.
- In the second case, he forms a large number of ropes into a semblance of a hand and, having grabbed the opponent with it, lifts him into the air and after crushing him on the ground.
