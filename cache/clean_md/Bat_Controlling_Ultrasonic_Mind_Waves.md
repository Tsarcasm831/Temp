# Bat Controlling: Ultrasonic Mind Waves

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Rinji
- Media: Anime

## Summary
Once Rinji controls his bats, he commands them to produce high frequency ultrasonic waves that affect the mind of the opponent. These bats (along with Shino's evolving insect strategy) have been the only effective counters to the Crystal Release.

## Notes
- The ultrasound waves move at a frequency that allowed the crystal to breakdown at a molecular level, allowing dispersion of crystal particles back into the air.
