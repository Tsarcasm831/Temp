# Black Secret Technique Machine One Shot

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Kankurō~~puppet~Kuroari~Karasu
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
This is a "dance of death" that Kankurō performs with puppets. He first uses Karasu, an attacking puppet, to strike at the target, causing targets to focus their attention on it.

## Counters / Defenses
- As they avoid its attacks, they are unwittingly navigated towards Kuroari, a capturing puppet, which seals them within its body.

## Drawbacks
- A victim is forced to stand straight up inside until they can no longer support themselves, at which point they are forced to lean on the spikes, resulting in a slow and painful death.

## Notes
- While they're trapped inside Kuroari, Karasu's head and six limbs are separated from its body, each of which has its own concealed blade.
- The seven blades are simultaneously inserted into slots on Kuroari's body, killing the target inside.
- * This technique is similar to the Devil's Torture Chamber, a magic trick where a magician appears to stab their assistant - who is confined within a box - with swords.
- * The English translation of this technique's name is a reference to the iron maiden, a coffin-like torture device with sharp spikes lining the inside.
- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm , Kuroari gets impaled in mid-air, is slammed to the ground, and then explodes.
