## Summary
The Eight Trigrams Sealing Style is a fūinjutsu of the Uzumaki clan. A stronger seal is created if two Four Symbols Seal are used; this is called the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.

## Counters / Defenses
- If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's chakra to merge with whoever they've been sealed into.
- Minato Namikaze used the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style to seal the Nine-Tails into his infant son, Naruto Uzumaki.
- Before Minato performed the seal, he summoned a ceremonial altar that he placed Naruto on.
- Naruto's seal is located on his abdomen, but only becomes visible when he uses the Nine-Tails' chakra.
- As an additional safety measure, Minato also sealed the chakra of himself and Naruto's mother, Kushina Uzumaki, into Naruto, who would appear before him under certain circumstances: Minato appears when the Nine-Tails nearly convinces Naruto to remove the seal, stops him from going through with it, and then reinforces the seal; Kushina appears when Naruto is trying to replace the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style with a new seal, and gives him the support he needs to tame the Nine-Tails.
- After this key is passed to Naruto, he uses it to remove the seal in preparation for replacing it with a stronger one.
- * In the manga, after transferring the chakra of Kurama's Yin-half into an incapacitated Naruto Uzumaki, Obito Uchiha was also shown reestablishing this seal.
- * In the anime, Orochimaru suited Mecha-Naruto with this seal in order to take the Nine-Tails from Naruto.

## Notes
- When Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways.
- The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising.
- The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them, but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.
- The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.
- When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.
