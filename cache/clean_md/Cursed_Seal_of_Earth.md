## Summary
The Cursed Seal of Earth is one of the strongest of Orochimaru's cursed seals, the other being its counterpart: the Cursed Seal of Heaven. The seal is located on the upper portion of Kimimaro's chest over his manubrium.

## Counters / Defenses
- When the first level is activated, the seal turns orange-red and expands in lines spreading all over Kimimaro's body in contorting and parallel lines.
- When the second level of the seal is active, Kimimaro takes on a dinosaur-like appearance complete with a tail.
- Like all cursed seals, Kimimaro receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and his ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active.

## Notes
- Several large bones also protrude from his darkened skin and gains four distinguishing figures: two dark black curved like markings under his eyes - one under each eye and two as elongated eyebrows - one above each eye.
- The second level also increases his healing might, as his torn flesh was instantly restored upon his transformation.
- Kimimaro must enter his second level in order to properly use the Dance of the Clematis: Flower, due to the resultant weapon's size and density.
- In his second level, he can also merge with the bone blades created by his Dance of the Seedling Fern, allowing him to launch a deadly surprise attack at his target's blindspot.
