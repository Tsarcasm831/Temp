## Summary

## Notes
- When a transformed user has been found out and attacked, they ordinarily allow the transformation to dispel.
- Some users may maintain the transformation in a final attempt to keep their cover, only dispelling the transformation once this effort fails.
- Tsunade uses the Transformation Technique to constantly appear several decades younger, keeping it active regardless of where she is or what she's doing.
- She only reverts to her original form when she no longer has the chakra to maintain her transformation.
- In the anime, Kagerō also keeps her Transformation Technique active for long periods of time, taking the form of a buck-toothed, hunchbacked man.
- In Akatsuki Hiden , the citizens of Shangri-la use the Transformation Technique at all times in a concerted effort to make new lives for themselves; their transformations only dispel when they die.
