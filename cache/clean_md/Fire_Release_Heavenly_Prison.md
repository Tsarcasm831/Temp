## Summary
The Fire Release: Heavenly Prison is an used by Mui's clan. It will also drain them of their chakra at a slow but steady rate.

## Counters / Defenses
- If the ones who have the seal on them leaves a certain radius from the applier, then it would cause the victims to burst into flames from the inside, burning them to ashes.
- The user can also ignite the seal at their own free will.
- The techniques used, however, will be severely hampered, and the seal will cause the user in question intense pain, as though their bodies were on fire; if too much chakra is forced out, the formula will set the victim ablaze.

## Drawbacks
- * The Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice has been considered to be on par with the Heavenly Prison in terms of restraining prisoners, hence the reason its user was named Mui's successor as Hōzuki Castle's master.

## Notes
- Mui uses this technique on the prisoners of the Hōzuki Castle.
- However, for people with high amounts of chakra, such as Naruto, they can still mould chakra and use techniques to a certain extent.
- It is possible for an individual to undo the Heavenly Prison placed by another, as Benga undid "Tsukiyo's" that was placed by Mujō.
- This may be what Mui did on Maroi.
- * Despite Naruto being branded with this technique, when he transformed into Sage Mode, he was able to leave a great distance from Mui when Gamabunta escaped the castle to rethink their strategy without Naruto bursting into flames.
