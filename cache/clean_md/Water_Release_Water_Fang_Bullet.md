## Summary
The user forms projectiles underwater; the water that the projectiles are made of is highly pressurised because of how compact they are. The projectiles are then shot from the water at high speeds at the user's target, which can be made more lethal by adding a spinning motion.

## Notes
- This technique is especially useful during fights taking place on top of water, as the projectiles can be shot at the target from any direction, ideally blind-spots.
- Users will often try to distract targets before using this technique against them, or even use this technique itself as a distraction.
- or a single user can create several smaller projectiles in a scattershot manner.
