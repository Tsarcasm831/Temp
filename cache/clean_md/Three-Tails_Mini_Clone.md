# Three-Tails Mini Clone

## Quick Facts

## Summary
When the Three-Tails devours anything, its body produces thousands of smaller clones of itself with its gut. These antibody-like clones attack and devour the invading organism, presumably to aid in digestion and destroy any potential hazards.

## Counters / Defenses
- The Three-Tails has the ability to create different sizes of its mini clones: from the size of a hand to the size of a human being, and they are resilient enough to resist Guren's crystal techniques and kunai.
