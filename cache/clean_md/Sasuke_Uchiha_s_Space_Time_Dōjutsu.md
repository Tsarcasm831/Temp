## Summary
With his Rinnegan, Sasuke can use an unspecified Space–Time Ninjutsu to travel to different dimensions. With it, Sasuke can travel to and from different dimensions that he can locate.

## Drawbacks
- Whereas Obito's accessing of another dimension required both his Mangekyō and additional chakra from Sakura, which still severely strained his body and sight, Sasuke showed no visible strain besides brief exhaustion from multiple uses.

## Notes
- This technique requires a large amount of chakra, and extended usage leaves Sasuke incapable of using this technique, his Mangekyō Sharingan, and his Rinnegan's full power, for some time.
- Sasuke also stated that the number of people who could enter the portal was limited: only the four Kage and Boruto Uzumaki joined him on the rescue mission to save Naruto; however, they were secretly followed through the portal by two people.
