## Summary
Truth-Seeking Balls are orbs of malleable black chakra, which can alter their form and characteristics in various ways. Though only the size of a fist, each hides within it the power to obliterate an entire forest.

## Usage
- Acquisition method may determine the number, as both Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha gained ten orbs upon becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki; Obito initially only formed two, obtaining the other eight upon gaining control of the Ten-Tails' power.
- In Naruto's case, the orbs currently under his control disappear and reappear alongside his chakra cloak, while the orbs he has discarded remain active.
- However, the orbs are incapable of nullifying senjutsu, as according to Naruto, natural energy can be used to combat itself.
- Whatever their shape, users can only control the orbs within 70 metres of their location, allowing opponents to disable them by transporting them elsewhere.

## Counters / Defenses
- Obito was able to manifest a single Truth-Seeking Ball after absorbing some of Madara's power.

## Notes
- whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo.
- Entering Tenseigan Chakra Mode also grants the user Truth-Seeking Balls.
- The number of Truth-Seeking Balls acquired varies from user to user.
- Upon receiving power from Hagoromo, Naruto Uzumaki, instead gained nine orbs, while Asura Ōtsutsuki only showed five orbs, nine orbs in the anime.
- Toneri Ōtsutsuki is depicted with an inconsistent amount.
- and users cannot create additional orbs after the initial acquisition number; thus, orbs that are lost for whatever reason cannot be replaced.
- Clones are not created with orbs of their own, though the user can temporarily transfer them to a clone.
- Truth-Seeking Balls encompass the power of all five basic natures, and as such they surpass both kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.
- If imbued with a certain Yin–Yang Release jutsu, the orbs can nullify any ninjutsu they touch and thus become impervious to it; this includes negating the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation, making it possible to permanently damage and kill those reincarnated by the technique.
- Naruto can use Truth-Seeking Balls to create his Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.
- Similarly, Obito was able to convert one of his orbs into black receivers, allowing him to use the Six Red Yang Formation.
- While in their default sphere form, the orbs can be launched as high-speed projectiles, expanded to enormous sizes in an instant.
- Because the high-density chakra is in a condensed state, it can be pulled and stretched into a smooth and flat consistency, as well as freely manipulated into any other shape.
- though Obito does so by passing them through holes that temporarily form in his hands.
- Though highly durable, this defence can still be broken by attacks that cannot be nullified, such as powerful senjutsu and taijutsu.

- Rather than simple black constructs, Toneri demonstrated the ability to transform one of these glowing orbs into an ornate golden cage.
- He could also combine them to create a massive vortex capable of blasting through the moon's surface and a giant sword capable of cutting the entire moon in half.
- * Despite stating that the orbs are wielded by Six Paths Senjutsu users, the fourth databook does not classify this technique as senjutsu.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and Jump Force , Truth-Seeking Balls give off a purple glow.
- In the former, Obito employs the orbs in several unique ways, such as forming scythes, drills, spinning disks, hands capable of firing Tailed Beast Balls and blasts of chakra.
- * Despite repeatedly accessing his orbs every time he entered Six Paths Sage Mode during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has not been seen accessing them since whenever using said form.
- * In Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu , Obito has a technique called , in which he combines his Truth-Seeking Balls into a single expanding orb that obliterates the surrounding area.
- The technique refers to the Trailokya, the three realms of karmic rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.
