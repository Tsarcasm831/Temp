## Summary
The user creates a cloud of mist which they release from their mouth. This mist is highly acidic in nature, capable of melting bodies, and even chakra-based defences and barriers, nullifying them.

## Notes
- Even Sasuke Uchiha's Susanoo was affected, despite being considered an "absolute defence".
- Though the mist is corrosive to all around it, the user seems to be immune to it, as Mei used it in an enclosed area without endangering herself.
