## Summary
This technique combines Naruto Uzumaki's Wind Release: Rasenshuriken with Sasuke Uchiha's Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi along with their variants. Because the wind to flame ratio is perfectly balanced, the flames are greatly enhanced, causing whatever is struck by this technique to be enveloped in a swirling mass of black flames.

## Notes
- A smaller-scale version of this technique combined a normal Rasenshuriken and black flames manipulated with Kagutsuchi to form a flaming pinwheel.
- When the technique made contact with the target, they were launched backwards and likewise engulfed in the black flames.
- * The fact that this technique is referred to as Scorch Release is not because it is a kekkei genkai, but presumably because the basic elements fire and wind make up the actual advanced nature transformation of Scorch Release.
- * Referring to the original use of this technique, Tobirama Senju noted that he had never seen such a Kagutsuchi before, and that this technique had the same chakra ratio from both its parent techniques, which he noted was something tough to achieve, even for an experienced duo.
- * Unlike the Rasenshuriken, the small-scale version of this technique doesn't cause cellular damage to either user's arms.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , the jutsu works differently when used in story mode, circling around the Ten-Tails, creating a vortex around it.
- It also maintained the countless small attacks of the wind chakra.
- Naruto and Sasuke are also able to use it when in a combined awakening, in this case, the jutsu is called "Blaze Release: Rasenshuriken".
