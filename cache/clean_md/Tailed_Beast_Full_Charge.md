## Summary
All the Tailed Beasts gather together, after which they all head in to attack the opponent in the following order: Shukaku punches the opponent, Matatabi slashes them with its claws, Isobu bulldozes them towards Son Gokū, who kicks them, allowing Kokuō to thrust their body towards Saiken who then sprays them with acid, which leads to Chōmei knocking the opponent towards Gyūki, whose punch allows Kurama to ram them into the ground. After the sequence, the Tailed Beasts unite their tails into a single attack, pummelling their opponent.

## Notes
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , the Tailed Beasts use a similar attack, except all nine jinchūriki participate in it.
- * The name of this jutsu seems to be a pun on the Godzilla film .
