## Summary
The Hiding in Frost Technique produces visually clouding frost by causing the temperature of air to fall below the freezing point, effectively freezing any ambient water vapour in the vicinity. The frost allows the user to become transparent within it.

## Notes
- Upon being struck with an attack, the user becomes visible.
- The mist is visible to the naked eye, but since the user is transparent it voids that sense.
- An effective way of finding the user is tracking them through sound.
