- Range: Long
- Users: Kidōmaru, Kabuto Yakushi~game
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Kidōmaru first creates a war bow by carefully expelling Spider Sticky Gold from his mouth. With it he is able to fire arrows, using his body's eight limbs to boost the bow's tension beyond what normal people are capable of.

## Counters / Defenses
- By activating his cursed seal's second level, Kidōmaru gains a third eye which further increases his accuracy, allowing him to hit his target's vital spots from hundreds of metres away.

## Notes
- Because of how much power is put into each arrow, they travel incredibly quickly, too fast to see.
- to the point that it is described as a "one hit kill".
- In the anime, after being reincarnated, Kidōmaru can simultaneously fire three arrows.
- * While the databook states Kidōmaru boosts the tension of the bow with his eight spider limbs, which was what he did against Neji for the first shot, the next two shots he fired were only using two arms, despite retaining the same destructive force behind them.
