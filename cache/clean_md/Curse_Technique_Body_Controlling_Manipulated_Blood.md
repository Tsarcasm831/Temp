## Summary
A jujutsu technique which requires both the user and their opponent be standing within a Jashin symbol, as well as obtaining the victim's blood and using it on their puppet. Afterwards, the puppet and victim become connected, allowing any damage done to the puppet to be shared with the connected individual.

## Notes
- Even if the victim dies, the connection isn't severed, leaving their corpse to eternally be a puppet.
- Kakashi also questioned the validity of such Jashin documents.
