## Summary
The grants the user two main abilities: interrogation and restoration, by using the King of Hell. Pain channelled the power of the Naraka Path through the body of a priest.

## Usage
- If the person was lying or refused to answer the questions, the King of Hell would remove their tongue and consume it, apparently killing them.

## Counters / Defenses
- * In Buddhism, the Naraka realm, or "hell realm", is a plane of rebirth, based on Karma (actions of body, speech, and mind) built up in a previous life or lives.
- There are various Naraka, each containing beings that are tormented until their Karma has achieved its full and satisfactory results.

## Drawbacks
- However, if they told the truth, they would be spared, although left extremely exhausted.
- With its restorative abilities, the Naraka Path can easily be regarded as the most valuable body if the Six Paths of Pain is being used through six different bodies.

## Notes
- The Naraka Path ability makes heavy use of the King of Hell.
- The King of Hell is a large head which sprouts out of the ground surrounded by purple flames.
- It also possesses the Rinnegan as well as the shared field of vision along with the other summons.
- To interrogate, the Naraka Path need only catch hold of a person, causing the King of Hell to appear before them.
- With the victim seemingly paralysed, the Naraka Path begins questioning them.
- After answers are given, the King of Hell will unzip its mouth to release tendril-like arms and would draw out an apparition of the victim's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue.
- The King of Hell would then proceed to pass its judgement.
- The second ability the Naraka Path possessed is the ability to repair any damage.
- To do so the Naraka Path has the King of Hell ingest the damaged body with its tendril-like arms into its mouth, then, after some time, the destroyed body will emerge from its mouth, completely rejuvenated.
- It did this for example to the Asura Path after it was destroyed by Chōji and Chōza Akimichi.
- During formation, Nagato puts the Naraka Path at the rear behind the sentimental Deva Path with the other four taking the front lines.
- Kabuto Yakushi stated that a Naraka Path user can transport bodies and souls using the King of Hell.
- In Hinduism it is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins.
- Yama is the Lord of Justice and the King of Hell.
- He assigns appropriate punishments to living beings after death.
- For example, he might immerse them in boiling oil.
- If you lie to him, he will rip out your tongue.
- The beings can then be reborn into a higher plane.
- * The Naraka are superficially similar to the Christian hell or purgatory, although there are many significant differences.
