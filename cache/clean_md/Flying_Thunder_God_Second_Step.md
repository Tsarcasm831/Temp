## Summary
The Flying Thunder God — Second Step is a technique developed by Minato from the Flying Thunder God Technique. Minato first throws a Flying Thunder God Kunai, be it a direct attack at his opponent; once the kunai has reached close proximity to the target, or even past them, he would then teleport to the said kunai, immediately attacking his target from their blind-spot.

## Notes
- The speed at which this technique is executed along with the unpredicted secondary attack is such that even an individual who possesses the Sharingan is unable to react in time.
