## Summary
The Earth Release Resurrection Technique: Corpse Soil is a jutsu that reanimates the deceased using bodies made of dirt and soil. Kazuma described it as the ultimate Earth element resurrection technique.

## Usage
- The first version allows the user to seemingly continuously resurrect a large number of slain people as zombies, but with none of their rationality, physical prowess, or techniques at their disposal.
- The second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware.

## Counters / Defenses
- At any time, by performing a Snake hand seal and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.

## Notes
- They are fairly easy to destroy.
- If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.
- Unlike the Impure World Reincarnation technique, the soul is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed.
- This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e.
- electricity).
