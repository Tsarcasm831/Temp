## Summary
After creating a gigantic wooden statue that possesses hundreds or thousands of hands, the user utilises all of these hands simultaneously to deliver powerful blows to the target. Due to the sheer volume of the punches involved, defending against the entirety of them is nearly impossible.

## Usage
- This can be used as a one-shot technique, increasing its destructive power but also resulting in the hands behind the statue's back being destroyed.

## Notes
- Afterwards, Hashirama discards the back of the statue to increase the mobility of the True Several Thousand Hands statue.
- It can also be used more conservatively as seen in Tobi's usage, preventing the hands from being destroyed and enabling another usage of the technique, but results in less destructive power.
- In practical terms, this means a smaller Buddhist image attached to a larger one.
- Such depictions serve as an example of the many forms Buddhist deities can assume in order to save sentient beings.
- They are found most notably within the statues of Kannon, where a small image of Amida is placed atop Kannon's crown or held in the hands of Thousand-Armed Kannon.
- Also, through his Several Thousand Hands, his fists can break off and rain down like meteors onto the target.
