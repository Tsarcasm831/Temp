## Summary
It is a gunshot-like attack which uses Iron Sand hardened into minuscule grains to attack simultaneously across a vast range. The bullets are so fast that they are difficult to see.

## Notes
- The moment the user has finished preparing the attack, evading it becomes extremely difficult.
- Using the repellent force of magnetism, the speed of the bullets is rapidly increased after they are shot.
- Furthermore, the user can also use an attack pattern where the Iron Sand bullets are shaped into sharp needles, increasing their ability to wound or kill the opponent.
- Since the Iron Sand has a magnetic force and (when used by Sasori) is also drenched in poison, defending against this technique is almost impossible.
- This technique is especially threatening to puppet users, since the puppets can be rendered immobile if the sand gets lodged into their joints.
