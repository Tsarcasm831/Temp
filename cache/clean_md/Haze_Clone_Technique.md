# Haze Clone Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Oboro, Mubi, Kagari, H≈çki (Watari)~anime, Scarlet Blaze~game
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user creates hundreds of copies of themselves, each of which, like the standard Clone Technique, has no physical substance and thus cannot be attacked. While opponents attack the clones trying to locate the user, the user secretly moves underground so that opponents will preoccupy themselves looking for someone who isn't there.

## Notes
- Once the opponent is too distracted to defend themselves, the user will emerge from the ground in order to attack.
- * In the anime, Shisui Uchiha's Afterimage Clones produce an effect similar to the Haze Clone Technique.
