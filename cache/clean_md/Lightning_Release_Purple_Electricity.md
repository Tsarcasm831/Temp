## Summary
The user shoots a bolt of electricity from their hand to strike a target. It was invented by Kakashi Hatake as a replacement for the Lightning Cutter, which he could no longer safely use after the loss of his Sharingan.

## Notes
- In Kakashi Hiden , Kakashi typically uses Purple Electricity to strike targets from a distance, though he does sometimes use it through direct contact, as when he places his hand on spilled alcohol in order to transmit Purple Electricity throughout the surrounding area.
- He can modulate the intensity of the Purple Electricity, creating a blast strong enough to remove a target's explosive vest but without setting off the explosive or otherwise affecting the target.
- Conversely, he is later shown using all his chakra to perform a Purple Electricity powerful enough to induce the rain clouds he's falling through to start producing rain.
- Purple Electricity has sometimes been shown used in ways reminiscent of the Lightning Cutter and Chidori, with the user gathering lightning into their hand and quickly striking targets with it, or using it similarly to the Chidori Current, where the user releases bolts of purple lightning from all around their body in a omni-directional attack.
- After mastering Uchiha Style Kenjutsu under Sasukeâ€™s tutelage, Boruto learns to channel his own Purple Electricity through his blade, similar to Chidori Katana.
- * Before his manga debut at using it, Boruto was listed as being able to use this jutsu himself.
- * While he has yet to use the technique in the anime, Mitsuki is seen using it in the second version of the opening, BAKU.
