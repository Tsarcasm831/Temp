## Summary
The Acrobat is a kenjutsu used by Killer B in tandem with his swords and the standard technique of his unique Disturbance Taijutsu fighting style. More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body.

## Notes
- The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg.
- As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.
- The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise.
- He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha, and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H≈çzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.
- Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.
- The swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.
- Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.
- In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.
