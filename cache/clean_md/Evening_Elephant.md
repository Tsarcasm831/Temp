## Summary
The Evening Elephant is a high-level, forbidden taijutsu that can be performed by those who have opened all Eight Gates. Each "foot" creates a cannon of pressurised air bearing the appearance of an elephant's leg, causing devastating damage to the opponent.

## Notes
- The first punch alone was capable of tunnelling a massive and deep hole in the ground, and the final punch proved strong enough to shatter a Truth-Seeking Ball defence.
- The strength of several of these punches was enough to temporarily immobilise Madara Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' jinchÅ«riki.
