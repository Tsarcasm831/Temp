- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
The Regeneration Ability is a power lying inside the cells of Hashirama Senju, which is able to heal the injuries of anyone imbued with them in mere moments. The enhanced regeneration granted by the cells is so rapid that even dozens of puncture wounds, on top of various injuries inflicted by the combined physical assault of all nine tailed beasts were completely healed in mere moments.

## Notes
- This ability does not appear to extend to severed limbs as Madara instead replaced his severed arm with that of a White Zetsu clone's.
- as he regenerated the half of his torso blown away by Night Guy and regenerated even after Sasuke Uchiha fully bisected him at the waist.
- * With the genetic tissue transplanted into Madara and the artificial limbs for Obito each comprised of Hashirama's DNA, they both not only gained Hashirama's healing abilities, but also they no longer required any food or water to survive.
- However, it is unknown if these two traits are related or if Hashirama himself was also endowed with the latter.
- * Though Jūgo was in possession of Hashirama's cells at one point, he automatically converted them into his own before having a chance to use this ability.
- * Those who possess a fragment of the Stone of Gelel inside their bodies will gain regenerative powers comparable to this ability.
- * In the anime, Mugino states to be able to use Wood Release a person must have the First Hokage's cells, which suggests that the Wood Release user Moegi Kazamatsuri has access to this ability.
- * In the anime, rumors have spread that the Regeneration Ability also will restore one's youth and extend their longevity.
- Konoha-nin however have denied such claims.
