A self-proclaimed invincible barrier; using hand gestures, the user is able to create a protective barrier of wind capable of repelling any incoming attack they perceive, back on the original user with equal or greater force. In the anime, even if an attack proves too powerful to repel, the barrier will cushion enough of the attack to save the user from an otherwise deadly assault.
