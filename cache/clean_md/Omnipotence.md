# Omnipotence

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Shinjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Ada, Shibai Ōtsutsuki~manga
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
Omnipotence is a shinjutsu claimed to be used only by a god, whose effect is to bring out the user's desires. It is described as a programming language that Gods have used to create worlds and to make anything real.

## Usage
- Akin to genjutsu, this power is capable of affecting the mind of others, but unlike other genjutsu, this jutsu can be used on a far greater scale.
- Similar to the Infinite Tsukuyomi, this jutsu can be used on a worldwide scale, manipulating the memories of everyone on the planet to how the user sees fit.
- However, because she is not an actual Ōtsutsuki, she has no conscious control of this technique, only able to instinctively use it to grant her deepest desires.
- * The official Naruto website states that Omnipotence was used to create the current world.

## Counters / Defenses
- Despite being affected, Sasuke seemed to be able to avoid the lingering effects of the changes by focusing on the initial contradictions right after the memory rewriting took effect.

## Drawbacks
- When Sarada and Sumire consulted Ada, she thought it was impossible to reverse the change, finding it more practical to rewrite new memories, which carried its own risks.

## Notes
- Because of this ability, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki declared this technique to be the most powerful shinjutsu.
- Her first known use of this shinjutsu was charming everyone, both male and female, around her with her desire to find true love.
- The only exceptions to the charm are family members and the Ōtsutsuki clan.
- Later, desiring to please Kawaki, along with channeling Kawaki's desire for Boruto to be viewed as an outsider like him, Ada’s subconscious caused this power to rewrite the memories of everyone on a global scale, even those removed from the dimension Omnipotence was cast in, to perceive Kawaki as the son of the Seventh Hokage and Boruto as the outsider taken in by the Hokage, effectively making the two switch lives with each other.
- Beyond the initial rewrite, over the next three years, Omnipotence also suppressed any lingering sense of contradiction in those affected, such as Kawaki's body being modified by Kara despite supposedly being born and raised in Konoha, as well as Momoshiki's absence, and those confronted about the changes become more stubborn in their refusal, even if they are confronted with visual evidence.
- Even the concept of Omnipotence is removed from the minds it affects, so if someone is told that the memory rewrite took place, the knowledge about it will fade.
- Ada similarly found it more likely that the affected majority would think the immune minority were the ones whose memories were tampered with if anyone tried reasoning with them.
- Three years in, Mitsuki was taken aback by Kawaki's harsh treatment of him, and took notice of these feelings.
- Similarly, Amado was able to recognise his own alterations in Kawaki's body, deducing his own memories must have been altered.
- Hearing a report on Amado's theory, Shikamaru Nara began recognising that puzzling situations made more sense when memory alteration was considered.
- If one is able to realise the truth that memories were altered without learning about Omnipotence, accepting as truth by themselves, is possible to retain some of that knowledge, something Boruto considers "no mean feat".
- * The official Naruto website calls Ada's expression of Omnipotence .
- * For reasons unknown, Sarada Uchiha and Sumire Kakei seem to be immune to Omnipotence cast by Ada.
- * According to Momoshiki, those who are immune to the technique are the ones who will suffer the most from it.
