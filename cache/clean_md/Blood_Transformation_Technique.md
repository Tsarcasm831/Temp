## Summary
Using the Ketsuryūgan's ability to manipulate a target's iron-rich blood, the user can expand the blood in the target's body. Doing so, it will cause the body to morph into a much larger version, effectively disguising the target to be indistinguishable from their true form.

## Notes
- By cutting their wrists to expel the extra blood, the target will return to their original state.
