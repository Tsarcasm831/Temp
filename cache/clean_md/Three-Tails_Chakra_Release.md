# Three-Tails Chakra: Release

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Chakra Flow
- Users: Yūkimaru
- Media: Anime

## Summary
Due to his mysterious connection to the Three-Tails, Yūkimaru is able to at least partially control the Three-Tails. At first, Yūkimaru can only make an apparition of the beast appear, after taking some of Kabuto's pills.

## Usage
- Later, after taking a larger dosage of the pills (combined with Guren's Crystal Release technique) he is able to make the beast fully appear, but couldn't control it.

## Counters / Defenses
- When Guren seemingly sacrificed her life to save him, Yūkimaru lost control of himself and used his powers to the fullest which enhanced the Three-Tails strength and rampage enabling it to break through the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.

## Notes
- Later, when Guren is in danger of being harmed by the Three-Tailed Beast, he is able to halt it completely without Kabuto's pills.
- This could mean that, like Naruto's jinchūriki forms, this ability is tied to his emotions.
- Shizune concluded that due to the extensive toll this ability took on Yūkimaru's body, his lifespan was shortened, and he lost the ability altogether.
