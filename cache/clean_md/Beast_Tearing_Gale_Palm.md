## Summary
This technique is somewhat of an enhanced version of the Beast Tearing Palm. It uses chakra to infuse with and condense a mass amount of wind-chakra to form a massive demonic-like claw extending from the user's hand to strike and grab a target, as well as deflect any weapon or attack.

## Notes
- Depending on its use, the user can manipulate the size and length of the claw to attack and defend at any range.
- In addition to making it a deadly weapon, the extending claw also carries tremendous force that can devastate anything in its path without affecting the user, making it useful for dislodging solid and heavy objects.
