## Summary
Chibaku Tensei is a technique used through the Deva Path of the Rinnegan. When the sphere is activated, it generates powerful attractive force, pulling everything in the vicinity to it until a large satellite is created; users control how large the satellite becomes.

## Drawbacks
- Creating a satellite apparently requires a great deal of chakra, such that Nagato, when attempting to use it through his Six Paths of Pain, must first bring the Deva Path close to his location so that he can channel his chakra to it more effectively, although it was done in his heavily exhausted state.
- Chibaku Tensei is most often used to restrain targets, drawing them in during the satellite's creation and trapping them beneath the mounds of rubble.
- Rather than use the satellites to restrain targets, Madara uses them as large projectiles that he drops on his opponents.
- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 , Pain uses Chibaku Tensei to summon a whirlwind of boulders to protect himself against attacks.
- *In Ultimate Ninja Impact , Pain creates the planetary body and brings it down on his opponents.
- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution , as part of Pain and Konan's collaboration, Pain uses this technique to trap his opponent and then Konan lines the debris with explosive tags.

## Notes
- Only Naruto Uzumaki, by entering a near-Tailed Beast Mode, has been known to break free from one.
- When performed by Sasuke Uchiha, he does not use the typical black sphere, instead gathering rubble around each of his immobilised targets; this is similar to the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei.
- Once the satellites are formed, Sasuke is able to move them remotely.
- Madara Uchiha is also shown creating multiple satellites at a time, each with its own black sphere.
- In the game it is called "Six Paths Technique" rather than Chibaku Tensei.
- An enhanced, "Full Throttle" version of the technique called can also be performed.
- He can also launch the boulders individually as a form of attack.
- He also uses this as his Awakening, where he summons a whirlwind of boulders as a defensive system and an offensive system at the same time.
- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 , Nagato uses this technique to imprison his opponent, and then fires a chakra blast which goes through its core, causing a massive explosion.
- Konan then sends a single origami bird which causes a massive explosion.
- *In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Rinnegan Sasuke pierces the opponent with the black flames, traps him within Chibaku Tensei, and then destroys it with Chidori Kagutsuchi via his Complete Body — Susanoo.
- His The Last version also uses the technique as part of his Chidori: Star Crusher.
- And during the boss battle against Naruto and Sasuke, Madara is able to create a gargantuan version of Chibaku Tensei by merging multiple planetoids into one with the Wood Release.
