## Quick Facts
- Classification: Fūinjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yūhi~anime
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
This technique suppresses the power of a cursed seal. Because applying cursed seals in the first place requires a great deal of skill, suppressing one with this technique also requires a great deal of skill.

## Counters / Defenses
- The preparations needed for this technique are quite arduous: the blood acting as a chain that prevents the cursed seal from spreading.
- This ends up not being enough for Sasuke and he willingly accepts the Cursed Seal of Heaven's influence.
- Over the following years, the Evil Sealing Method remains imprinted upon him, but inert since Sasuke has no need for it.
- When the cursed seal is ultimately removed, the Evil Sealing Method is removed as well.

## Notes
- In the anime, Kurenai Yūhi uses this technique to hold back the Kurama Clan's Kekkei Genkai.
