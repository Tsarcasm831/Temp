## Summary
After the user draws a gigantic tiger, the illustration extends from the scroll and while still connected, captures its prey with its teeth and claws, before dragging the victim back into the scroll and pinning them down within the confines of the drawing. Due to the enormity of the illustration, the user requires an extended period of time to complete the image, during which they need protection as their attention is devoted to drawing.

## Usage
- Because of his training in Root, this was initially impossible for Sai to control, but later, after seeing Rock Lee's determination to protect his comrades and remembering his time with Team Kakashi, he was able to.

## Notes
- In the anime, Danzō noted that to make this technique stronger, Sai would have to make use of his emotions.
- If the user is consumed by negative emotions, their eyes turn black, their pupils will turn red, and they will secrete a dark substance from their eyes and mouth.
