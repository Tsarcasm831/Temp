# Soft Physique Modification

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Kabuto Yakushi, Misumi Tsurugi, Mitsuki, Orochimaru, Mizuki~anime, Nurari~anime,
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie canon

## Summary
Before this technique can be performed, the user's body must first be modified to increase its flexibility and elasticity. Once this is done, the user can stretch and bend their body however and whenever they please, extending it to great lengths and retracting it again.

## Counters / Defenses
- The worst of these preyed on humans or bit them and drank their blood (much like how Orochimaru gives his cursed seals).

## Drawbacks
- In combat, users can wrap around targets to restrain or constrict them, or strike at them with their limbs, the limbs' length making them similar to whips.

## Notes
- Cursed, these monsters had infinitely extendable necks and used them to spy on mortals.
