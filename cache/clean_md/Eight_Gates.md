# Eight Gates

## Quick Facts
- Users: Might Duy, Might Guy, Rock Lee, Kakashi Hatake, Metal Lee~anime, Shinnō~movie
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
The Eight Gates are eight specific tenketsu along the chakra pathway system. Normally, individuals can use no more than 20% of their body's full potential, the brain's way of protecting the individual from harming their body through overexertion.

## Drawbacks
- Opening the gate on this occasion also causes Lee's nose to start bleeding.
- After opening this gate, Guy's muscle fibers rupture, causing him intense pain if anyone touches him.

## Notes
- With training, individuals can learn to remove these limiters, referred to as "opening" the gates.
- With each opened gate, individuals are given access to more and more of their body's chakra, thus increasing their physical strength and speed.
- Since Madara's era, there have only been a few known users:
* Might Duy learned to open all Eight Gates after twenty years of extensive training.
- * Might Guy, Duy's son, was taught how to open all Eight Gates by his father.
- By adulthood, Lee had mastered all eight gates.
- * In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Rock Lee and the Suicide Corps could open the Sixth Gate to use a collaboration technique called the Crane Wing Formation.
- * In the anime, Metal Lee, Rock Lee's son, is shown subconsciously opening the first gate.
- * Kakashi Hatake is seemingly able to open the first gate, as seen when he activates it during a Cliff Climbing Practice.
- The anime later shows him opening it explicitly.
- Learning to open any of the Eight Gates is apparently very difficult, as Kakashi is surprised when he's told that Lee - only thirteen years old at the time - can open five gates; Kakashi notes that such an accomplishment is impossible through hard work alone.
- Part of Kakashi's surprise is also because he does not believe it was wise for Guy to teach Lee to open the gates in the first place: although opening the gates does briefly give the user power greater than what they're normally capable of, this increased power causes the user serious harm.
- When opening the eighth and final gate, users will die as a consequence, their bodies being unable to survive the immense amounts of chakra flowing through them.
- Because of this, Duy developed a self-rule to dictate when it was acceptable to open any of the Eight Gates, a rule he passed to Guy, Rock Lee has also been known to use the Eight Gates to defend his nindō, the dream by which he leads his life.
- To have all of the Eight Gates open at once is known as Eight Gates Released Formation.
- # The is located on the spinal cord.
- Rock Lee opens this gate as he's about to use the Reverse Lotus, seemingly to increase his speed; as he performs the Reverse Lotus, his muscles start to tear.
- # The , located in the stomach, increases all the user's abilities.
- The power that emanates from the user is enough to displace surrounding bodies of water.
- # The is located at the heart.
- Users open this gate by puncturing their chest with their thumb in order to direct the chakra there.
- * After Might Guy opens all Eight Gates, he is saved from death by Naruto Uzumaki's Yin–Yang Release.
