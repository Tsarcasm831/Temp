## Summary
Contrary to its counterpart, this technique reduces one's gravity, making it much lighter. The atmosphere, along with their body, can be lightened in order to take flight and increasing their manoeuvrability.

## Usage
- With enough practice, the user can control their flight through the sky with specific bodily movements.

## Drawbacks
- * Pain, Obito and Madara Uchiha have all demonstrated the ability to levitate, though it's not clear if this technique was responsible for the feat.

## Notes
- However, a consequence of using this technique on oneself or another individual is a decrease in the physical force of the affected person's attacks.
- Ōnoki, who possessed a mastery over this technique, was able to also manipulate the weight of other targets.
- By touching his target, he could instead take their gravity away and regulate just how much is taken.
- Although, all of them did have mastery over Earth Release at the time.
