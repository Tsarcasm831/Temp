## Summary
Unsealing a Rasengan from his Rinnegan, Momoshiki amplifies the chakra giving it a red colour and to increase its size to a giant scale, which rivals Boruto Uzumaki's own amplified Rasengan. * Before Momoshiki obtained this Rasengan, it originally belonged to Konohamaru Sarutobi, who sealed it into Katasuke's Kote.
