# Exploding Insect

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Media: Anime

## Summary
The user blinds the enemy with a smokescreen to scatter larvae that if inhaled, will grow inside their bodies into a spider-like parasite that explodes, killing the host. The insect's growth depends on how much chakra the host is using and a massive amount of chakra can speed up the growth process.

## Notes
- The insect can however be removed by the means of surgery, though it is difficult, as one mistake could cause the insect to explode.
- The Nokizaru Group, notable users of this technique, regularly taunts their victims into attacking after being exposed, thereby accelerating the process.
