## Summary

## Notes
- in the anime, Naruto helps him improve by having him look at naked women.
- With practice, Konohamaru is eventually able to use this technique effectively, though Rin no Sho describes his version as not having the same "wow" factor as Naruto's.
- On the other hand, Ebisu only blushes to see it and is otherwise unmoved; for cases such as these, Naruto created the Harem Technique, which does indeed defeat Ebisu.
