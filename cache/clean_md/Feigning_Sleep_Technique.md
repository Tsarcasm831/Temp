# Feigning Sleep Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Gaara
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Gaara uses this technique to force himself to fall asleep. This causes him to surrender control to Shukaku, who is sealed within him.

## Drawbacks
- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm , Naruto uses a similar technique while in a pyjama costume, causing him to fall asleep while his health bar recovers.

## Notes
- While it is the dominant personality, Shukaku has complete access to its large chakra reserves, which it uses according to its inherently destructive tendencies.
- Gaara emerges from the replica's forehead in order to perform this technique, where his body remains even after he's asleep.
- This represents a vulnerability, as opponents can focus their attacks on Gaara with the goal of rousing him.
- If they do successfully wake Gaara, Shukaku's personality will be suppressed again.
- This is a reference to Shukaku being a tanuki.
