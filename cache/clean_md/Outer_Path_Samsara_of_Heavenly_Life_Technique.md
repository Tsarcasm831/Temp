## Summary
The Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique is a reincarnation ninjutsu used through the Outer Path, which can infuse new life into the bodies of the dead in exchange for the user's own life. These souls may be recalled from even the crossroad between life and the afterlife, and are then returned to their rejuvenated bodies.

## Usage
- This technique can also be used to transform the corpse vessel of an individual revived by Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation into a real body of living flesh and blood.

## Drawbacks
- The revived individuals are seemingly revived with a fully restored chakra level, as Kakashi did not require hospitalization to recover after revival, and was able to carry Naruto after he nearly passes out after his fight with Pain.

## Notes
- The exact limitations of this technique are unknown, but on one occasion, it was able to resurrect a large number of individuals who had recently died.
- While using this technique, the caster is severely weakened; for instance, Nagato's hair turned white as a result of overexerting his power.
- Ultimately, once the technique is finished, the user invariably dies.
- However, whereas the rest of the reincarnated Madara Uchiha's body was made real, his eyes instead crumbled into dust upon his resurrection.
- This method does not require the King of Hell to appear.
- * Hashirama Senju identified this technique as a .
- * When Nagato was preparing to use this technique, Konan feared for the worst due to his low chakra levels, implying she believed he could have potentially survived with more chakra.
- Madara would eventually be revived by Impure World Reincarnation instead, and expressed surprise and disappointment that his return didn't go as planned, as only a living person can become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki.
- After this, Naruto temporarily stabilised Obito's life force using his Six Paths Yang Power like he did with Might Guy after he used the Eight Gates Released Formation, allowing him to bring back Sasuke and later battle against Kaguya Ōtsutsuki.
- However, as the both noted, Obito would still die as a result from using this technique.
