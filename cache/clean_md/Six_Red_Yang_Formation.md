## Summary
This is a barrier technique of the highest calibre, surpassing the Four Red Yang Formation in terms of both scale and durability. It is a barrier created by oneself that is impossible for anyone to step past, though it can only be used by those blessed with Six Paths Power.

## Counters / Defenses
- Like its smaller counterpart, the barrier is highly malleable, being capable of withstanding the explosion of four enormous Tailed Beast Balls derived from the power of the Ten-Tails by dispersing their force upwards and into the sky.
- However, as with similar techniques, the barrier can still be bypassed through the use of space–time ninjutsu such as the Flying Thunder God Technique.

## Notes
- The barrier's creator can also deactivate it at will, as well as apparently reactivate it at a later time if necessary.
- * The fourth databook makes no mention of this technique involving a Truth-Seeking Ball, instead stating that it utilises the Rinnegan's trademark black receivers.
