## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Users: Naruto Uzumaki
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
The Tailed Beast Rasengan is an incomplete technique of Naruto Uzumaki. It attempts to use the Rasengan's form to create a substitute for the Tailed Beast Ball.

## Usage
- * In the anime-exclusive Power arc, Naruto managed to create an incomplete yet effective Tailed Beast Rasengan (before he had absolute control of the Nine-Tails' chakra) which was able to petrify his Nine-Tailed clone.

## Notes
- At the start of his training, Naruto finds some difficulty making the ratio of black and white chakra 8:2.
- Despite the fact that Naruto was in his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he still sustained injuries on his hand when practising the technique.
- Naruto asks Killer B to watch and tell him when he has got the ratio right so he can remember the feel of the technique.
- Naruto has also noted that this new Rasengan is quite heavy, as he can barely hold it up.
- This is likely because of the Nine-Tails' chakra, which has been described as very dense in previous instances.
- According to Killer B, he has almost perfected it, and the best way to learn and master it was from real-life experience on the battlefield.
- Later, during the Fourth Shinobi World War, after gaining Kurama's cooperation, Naruto gained the ability to use the Tailed Beast Ball, and subsequently, developed the Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, leaving the completion of this technique unnecessary.
