## Summary
This is a flying kick directed at an opponent, typically their face. The kick serves two simultaneous purposes: as a surprise attack, as an act of self-sacrifice, with the user's exaggerated stance, confident expression, and the sheer inconceivableness of the attack combining to intimidate the opponent, in the process enhancing the kick's offensive potential.

## Notes
- Because the kick's effectiveness very much relies on appearance, any faltering of resolve will weaken it: when Might Guy realizes mid-flight that he's attacking Jiraiya, an ally, his surprise causes his kick to do less damage than it otherwise would have.
