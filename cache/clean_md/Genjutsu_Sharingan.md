## Summary
Genjutsu: Sharingan broadly refers to a range of genjutsu performed with the Sharingan. It has also been shown to be performed through the Sharingan's higher evolutions: the Mangekyō Sharingan and the Rinnegan.

## Usage
- Members of the Uchiha clan are particularly famous for using their Sharingan to control the Nine-Tails, so much so that Konoha quickly came to suspect Uchiha involvement in the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack.
- * A shadowy version of Sasuke's humanoid Susanoo first appears in a genjutsu he creates,
* Despite genjutsu working by altering the chakra flow of a target's cerebral nervous system, this technique affected Mecha-Naruto who doesn't have a brain.

## Notes
- Sasuke Uchiha is noted to be able to use the technique through his Rinnegan, to trap all the tailed beasts in a genjutsu with a mere glance.
- The illusions created by Genjutsu: Sharingan do not appear to have any trademark form, appearing vastly different between the same functions and even the same users.
- For example, Sasuke typically uses it to render targets unconscious, yet on the first occasion the target's body is pierced with large feathers, on another, the target is grasped and overwhelmed by a shadowy figure, and on the third the target experiences Sasuke personally stabbing them.
- However, this wasn't required in Sasuke's usage.
