## Summary
The One's Own Life Reincarnation is a technique that was developed in Sunagakure's Puppet Brigade. This technique can be used on both the living and dead.

## Drawbacks
- Using it on the living can save and restore the target from an otherwise fatal condition but will leave the user greatly exhausted.

## Notes
- When used on the dead, the user will find certain death in exchange for the soul of the deceased.
- While in use, the released chakra shines a pale-blue colour, and if the user's own chakra is insufficient, a third party can assist, but only the actual user of the jutsu will die.
- As such, the only one who can use this technique is its developer, Chiyo, and as she is the sole known user, upon her death the technique is believed to be lost forever.
- * The purpose of the technique was to give life to puppets, increasing their efficiency in battle.
- Chiyo also wished to give the Mother and Father puppets the souls of Sasori's parents.
- * In the anime, Ranmaru was capable of restoring an almost dead Raiga similar to how Chiyo restored a fatally injured Sakura Haruno.
