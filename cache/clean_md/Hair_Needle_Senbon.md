## Counters / Defenses
- Jiraiya himself stating dodging this technique with speed alone is almost impossible and the only way to counter this technique is by blocking it.

## Notes
- At the same time that Jiraiya kneads chakra and fires the hair needles, Fukasaku and Shima activate Jiraiya's hair roots, causing the hair to grow at an accelerated rate thus making limitless rapid-fire possible.
- The sheer speed of this technique makes it the fastest attack with the widest range in Jiraiya's arsenal.
