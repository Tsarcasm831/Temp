- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Chino

## Summary
This technique was created by Chino after the Fourth Shinobi World War, who used information within minerals springs that came into contact with White Zetsu as a reference to structure the technique. The said chakra becomes poisonous to the target, making their bodies unstable.

## Drawbacks
- Should the target then begin to bleed, the chakra will be set off, causing the victim's body to become consumed in a pitch-black substance before inflating in a grotesque manner and finally exploding on a large and on a very destructive scale.

## Notes
- Only by blocking the chakra flow of the target or rendering them unconscious will nullify mutation and following explosion.
- With proper medical aid, the poisonous chakra can be extracted, saving the victim completely.
