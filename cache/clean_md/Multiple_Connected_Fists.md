## Summary
While occupying Sakon's body, Ukon adds his hands to Sakon's punches; when Sakon is about to punch something, both of Ukon's arms sprout from Sakon's arm. Ukon's punches can be performed simultaneously with Sakon's, increasing their combined power to the point of punching through rock, or Ukon can grab opponents to give Sakon's punch an easy target.
