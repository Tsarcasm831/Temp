## Summary
The user flows earth-chakra through their body, absorbing the properties of earth around them to form a skin-deep armour that is transparent and is only visible when light reflects off it. The armour is shown to be able to defend from all forms of blunt-force trauma.

## Counters / Defenses
- Because this technique works by constantly absorbed earth properties, it requires no extra chakra after initiating it, yet still needs a sufficient amount of stone to be performed.

## Drawbacks
- At the same time, it enhances the user's strength, allowing them to deliver powerful strikes and break free of restraints.
