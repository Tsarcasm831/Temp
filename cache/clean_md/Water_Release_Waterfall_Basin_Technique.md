## Summary
This is a technique which creates a waterfall by developing spring water in a place without water veins and manipulating the resulting water current to form a wave. This is a very convenient technique as it can be used for training or relaxation.

## Notes
- On the other hand, because it changes the environment on a large scale, it also has the effect of hiding one's location from the enemy by confusing them.
- The width of the water source, waterfall, and basin can be expanded as long as the user continues to send chakra in.
