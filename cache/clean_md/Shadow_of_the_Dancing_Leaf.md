## Summary
The user moves close behind a target and carefully matches their movements, following them in the same way that a leaf is followed by its shadow. Simply mimicking a target in this way does no harm to them, but it's useful as a setup for other techniques, such as the Front Lotus or the Lion Combo.

## Notes
- Because of how difficult it can be to use this technique, most genin are unlikely to be talented enough to perform it.
