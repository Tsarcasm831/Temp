## Summary
A secondary trap is laid under the Five-Seal Barrier. This technique is automatically started when the "forbidden" tags are removed.

## Counters / Defenses
- In order to cancel this technique and defeat their copy, the one who removed the tag has no choice but to somehow push past the previous limits that they had at the time they removed the tag.

## Drawbacks
- Because the double has a fixed amount of stamina and doesn't feel exhaustion, it has an advantage in a drawn-out battle.

## Notes
- An exact copy of the person who removed the tag appears with their appearance, weapons, battle skills, and so on.
