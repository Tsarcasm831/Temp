## Notes
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Sai joins Naruto in performing this technique and the two also force Sasuke to participate.
- Against most women, the technique knocks out the opponent immediately, but against men, Kaguya and other kunoichi, it distracts them long enough for Sasuke to launch an attack from behind the others.
