## Summary
A large volume of water is directed from a preexisting source or expelled high into the air from the mouth; to manipulate so much water at once requires a great deal of chakra. Once high enough, it cascades down onto the targeted area, resembling a giant waterfall.

## Notes
- The force of this waterfall is great enough to hollow out the ground, washing away everything in the area.
- In the aftermath, whatever remains will appear devastated, as though some sort of natural disaster has just occurred.
