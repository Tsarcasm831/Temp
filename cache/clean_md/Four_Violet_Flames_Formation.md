## Summary
A team of four stands in a square formation and then performs this technique, erecting a solid barrier between them. The barrier is made of purple flames, which will instantly engulf those who come into contact with it, thus preventing anyone from entering or leaving the area.

## Notes
- Because the barrier relies on all four users to maintain, attacking any one of them can bring down the barrier.
- To prevent this from happening, members of the Sound Four extend secondary barriers around themselves, making breaking out even more difficult.
