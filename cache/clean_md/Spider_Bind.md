# Spider Bind

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Kidōmaru
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Kidōmaru spits a web of threads from his mouth, the web's size being adjusted depending on how far away his targets are and how many he intends to trap. On contact, the web pushes targets away from Kidōmaru and wraps around them, trapping them.

## Notes
- Because Kidōmaru's threads are made sticky with chakra, escaping from them is difficult once trapped.
- Kidōmaru most often uses this technique in response to frontal attacks, the webs neutralising his opponents before they can harm him.
