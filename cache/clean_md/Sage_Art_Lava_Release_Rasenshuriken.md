## Summary
A powerful technique whereby Naruto, after accessing Son GokÅ«'s power, creates a Rasenshuriken with a lava-infused nucleus, the heat of which causes the blades themselves to emit steam. The technique is strong enough to destroy a target's legs, and when expanded, it was powerful enough to bisect the Ten-Tails' tree form completely.
