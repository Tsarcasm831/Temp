## Summary
This barrier is designed to prevent anyone from leaving its confines. Once within a certain range of the target, the user erects the barrier underfoot, rendering anyone within the seal formula incapable of escaping.

## Counters / Defenses
- Despite its strength, it can be overpowered as demonstrated when Naruto Uzumaki was able to easily break the seal by entering his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.

## Notes
- In the anime, it was shown that several people can combine their efforts to increase the strength of the technique.
- It causes an explosion if the opponent is caught up in it, and explodes on its own after a while if no opponent triggers it.
