## Summary
The user creates a large, flat, circular pool of water in front of their opponent. Its surface acts like a mirror, perfectly reflecting the attacking targets.

## Counters / Defenses
- As these reflections use the exact same technique as their counterpart — regardless of its type — they counter the attack completely, while repelling them in the process.

## Notes
- By then hooking onto and rotating the "mirror" 90° with their staff, the reflections emerge and materialise from the mirror, where they collide with the mirrored targets.
- However, upon impact, the reflections disperse into water.
