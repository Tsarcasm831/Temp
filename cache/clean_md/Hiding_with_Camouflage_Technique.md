## Summary
The user controls the reflection of light around their body using chakra, causing their form, shadow, and even breathing to become invisible to the unaided eye. Because they perfectly blend in with their surroundings, the user can sneak up behind an enemy without being noticed.

## Notes
- Dōjutsu such as the Sharingan or Byakugan can also see through it.
- In the anime, Pakkun is able to sniff out Nagare despite his use of this technique, while in Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom , Karenbana wore so much perfume that it nullified the technique's usefulness against Sakura Haruno.
