## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Yin Release
- Classification: Genjutsu, Scientific Ninja Tool Techniques
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Ōga
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This is a genjutsu used by Ōga, placing her victims in labyrinth like simulations with puzzles to solve for her experiments, with the assistance of the technology provided by Kara. Ōga can use the genjutsu anyway she sees fit, creating multiple rooms and landscapes, even those that exist in the real world, such as Kara's hideout, with traps and hazards.

## Counters / Defenses
- The objective is to find hidden hiding spots for the subjects to hide in to avoid being crushed.

## Notes
- She can operate as two individuals within the genjutsu; as an older man who guides them through the experiments she had conceived and as a kunoichi named Yatsume that is also one of the subjects to further study the others.
- Those who die within the genjutsu do not die in the real world, but they remain stasis in tanks until the genjutsu ends.
- There are two ways of ending the genjutsu: the captives must kill Ōga within it or the Illusion scroll that is keeping the genjutsu active must be removed.
- Should the former be chosen, Ōga would become comatose in the real world.
- The following various genjutsu experiments test the subjects ability to survive.
- ;Nine Lives

Before the first experiment, Ōga provided a test for any one of the subjects to participate.
- She had ten cards, nine are "death" while one was "life", and if the participant picks the "life" card, they live.
- A Kirigakure shinobi participated in this test, randomly picking a "death" card which resulted in him being killed by Ōga.
- ;Collapse

For the first experiment, Ōga placed the now twenty subjects on a crumbling platform in the middle of an abyss.
- The subjects are to reach a higher platform in order to survive.
- With the help of Kiseru, those who were not shinobi were able to reach it with ladders placed on the top.

;Light

In the second experiment, Ōga warped the remaining subjects in a dark room with candles.
- The objective is to keep the candles from going out before they reach the goal, otherwise the one whose candle is extinguished will die, with their life force connected to it.
- The subjects must traverse into a desert with an active sandstorm, which makes it difficult to keep the candles from going out.
- To extend the flame and prevent their candles from melting, Boruto, Shamo, "Yatsume", Kiseru and Namua combined theirs, keeping them all alive.
- However, Rokuro, Batta and Fūgo, who instructed the latter, claimed theirs from the remaining subjects, stocking up their candles.

;Pressure

In the third experiment, the subjects are sent to an empty room.
- There is a red button on one of the walls that needed to be pressed, which revealed spikes concealed in the ceiling.
- However, there is only one concealed spot for the subjects to hide in that is only room for one.
- Fugō claimed this spot, while Boruto and Batta located a weak point in the room's floor to expose in order for the subjects to hide.
- There was no casualties in this experiment and everyone proceeded to the next experiment.

;Sum

In the fourth experiment, Ōga provided eight red envelopes to the subjects and warped them to a rocky terrain, where they are all separated from each other.
- Contained within the envelopes are numbers ranging from 1 to 8.
- The objective is to fight the subjects for their cards in order to have a passing score of 7 or more.
- Whoever possesses a 7 from the start simply needs to reach the goal without being targeted by others.
- The subjects must have the required score within two hours or they fail, regardless if they have the required number.

;Final Experiment

Being an Anbu working undercover as an Outer for Kara, Kiseru helped Boruto seemingly escape the labyrinth genjutsu.
- However, Ōga set up one final experiment for the remaining subjects.
- The goal was to supposedly escape Ōga's lair, which appeared reminiscent to Kara's hideout in the real world.
- "Yatsume" obtained a map and key card from the Kusa Outer that Rokuro killed in the previous genjutsu to help the remaining three navigate the labyrinth.
- There were also traps within the labyrinth, even puppets of Ōga's male persona.
- When Boruto and "Yatsume" went further, the latter dropped her disguise and revealed herself as the real Ōga.
- Impressed with Boruto navigating through all her experiments, Ōga provided the means to end the genjutsu by killing her and removing the Illusion scroll in the real world that kept the genjutsu active for the other subjects.
- With being given a reason to live by Boruto, they broke out of the genjutsu together and Ōga ended the genjutsu herself for the rest of the subjects.
