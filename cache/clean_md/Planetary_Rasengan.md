# Planetary Rasengan

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu,
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Naruto Uzumaki
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie canon

## Summary
Naruto Uzumaki — while in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode — creates a Big Ball Rasengan in one of his hands, which is then surrounded by three regular-sized Rasengan, in a similar manner to moons around a planet. When coming into contact with a target, the disordered rotations of the individual Rasengan, created by the central and smaller ones spinning in different directions, interact with each other to form a massive and turbulent wave-like vortex.

## Notes
- The strength of this technique is so great that it even took a shinobi reincarnated by the Impure World Reincarnation technique a significant amount of time to regenerate, which they normally do instantly.
