# Intersection Method

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Taijutsu
- Class: Defensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Genshō Ryūdōin, Might Guy
- Media: Anime

## Summary
With this technique, the user is able to intercept and counter an oncoming taijutsu technique by raising the knee, and driving the elbow downwards at the same time. This catches the attacking limb between their two limbs, and drives the elbow down with great force, effectively shattering the bone.

## Counters / Defenses
- Genshō used this technique while disguised as Yagura to "break" Rock Lee's Leaf Whirlwind by intercepting his attacking leg.

## Notes
- Even though Lee's ankle was not broken due to protection from his ankle weights, he was forced to completely halt his training until the injury was fully healed.
