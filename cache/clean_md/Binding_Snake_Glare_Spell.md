## Summary
The user summons one or two large snakes which crawl out from one's sleeves, and coil around the enemy capturing them. This is a great technique for capturing someone alive, or for inflicting damage by constriction, and if the situation calls for it, the snakes can bite the victim with their poison fangs.

## Drawbacks
- It is said that even shinobi with great skill are unable to escape from this restraint.

## Notes
- With the summons specified beforehand, the procedure can be shortened by using blood on a summoning , making it possible to use the technique immediately.
- The further addition of the user's killing intent can weaken their target's resolve.
- Snakes summoned by this technique are on a whole other level in terms of intelligence and strength, compared to normal summons.
