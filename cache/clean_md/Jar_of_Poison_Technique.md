- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Torune Aburame
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
Using his rinkaichū, Torune gathers multiple infected corpses and contains them within a barrier where the decaying flesh will release a gas that in time will ignite an explosion and release the venomous insects in a huge swarm that could cover the surrounding landscape. According to Shino, the barrier accelerates the insect's multiplication.

## Counters / Defenses
- * The appearance of the barrier closely resembles that of the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.

## Notes
- When written as 孤独, it means "isolation", "loneliness", or "solitude".
- * This technique is likely based on Kodoku, a Japanese folk curse created by having various insects kill each other in a jar until the last survivor becomes a creature of supernatural influence.
- * As stated by Torune, the Jar of Poison Technique was labelled a kinjutsu due to the sheer volume of corpses required to execute it and the indiscriminate effects of the poisonous cloud.
