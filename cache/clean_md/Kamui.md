## Summary
Kamui is a space–time ninjutsu that can be used with Obito Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan. These transfers are often characterised by a spiralling void that targets swirl into or out of, distorting their form as they move between dimensions.

## Usage
- The user looks at a target and creates a "barrier space" around them, with the barrier's size being determined by the user.

## Counters / Defenses
- Targets that enter Kamui's dimension are completely untraceable, as not even their chakra can be detected while they're there.
- Targets that exit Kamui's dimension do so with varying force, either simply appearing at the ejection point or flying from it; if weapons, such as shuriken, are stored in Kamui's dimension, ejecting them forcefully gives Kamui's users an offensive application.
- Using Kamui is the only known way to travel to and from its dimension.
- This means that targets transferred there are trapped, forced to stay until Kamui's user lets them leave; Obito sometimes uses genjutsu on those he imprisons to keep them subdued.
- But because Obito's two Mangekyō Sharingan spend years with different users – Obito himself and Kakashi Hatake – this makes Obito and Kakashi essentially immune to each other's Kamui: although one of them can use Kamui on the other, the other can just use Kamui on themselves to escape.
- This also means they can block or counter each other's attempts to use Kamui on others.
- Obito, while in the Purgatory, was able to use Kamui to temporarily return his soul to Earth to continue assisting Kakashi by granting him the use of his Sharingan for a short time.
- Obito most often uses this version on himself, sucking himself into his right eye to enter Kamui's dimension and then exiting back to whatever location he pleases.
- Obito can perform this teleportation at will and doesn't need to designate his destination beforehand, Others can be sucked into Kamui's dimension through his eye in addition to or instead of Obito, and in fact it is faster for him to use Kamui on others than on himself.
- Obito is usually shown making physical contact with those he's using Kamui on, but this isn't always consistent.
- The other application of Obito's right Mangekyō, when activated, allows him to turn his body "intangible", automatically transferring body parts that otherwise would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into Kamui dimension.
- Alternatively, Obito uses this ability to pass through barriers or other obstacles

Obito also had an unspecified way of cancelling Kakashi's usage of the left eye's Kamui when he attempted to decapitate the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, even though he wasn't touching or relatively near the statue.
- When the user concentrates, anything within the barrier is pulled towards its centre, transferring the target to Kamui's dimension.
- Similarly, because Kamui is used with a Mangekyō Sharingan, repeated use damages Kakashi's vision, eventually reaching the point where it causes his eyes to bleed.
- When Kakashi receives chakra from the Nine-Tails, he is able to use Kamui faster, more often, and on targets as large as the Eight-Tails; he estimates that the Nine-Tails' chakra makes Kamui three times more powerful than usual.
- Madara Uchiha takes Obito's Mangekyō from Kakashi so that he can gain access to Kamui's dimension.
- Unlike with Obito, being the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki does not prevent Madara from using Kamui.
- While Kamui ordinarily only connects its dimension with the Earth, the user can synchronise Kamui with other space–time ninjutsu, allowing the user to travel to the other ninjutsu's target dimension.
- The two powers of Kamui can be used separately, even if to achieve a unified purpose: Obito once used the left Kamui to synchronise with Yomotsu Hirasaka, then used the right Kamui to teleport to its associated dimension.
- With the two Mangekyō, users can also perform Susanoo, through which they can create Kamui Shuriken.
- In a more general Japanese context, Kamui refers to the might and majesty of the gods, particularly the Shintō kami.
- * Unlike other Mangekyō Sharingan users, Obito's continuous and general usage of Kamui does not seem to deteriorate his eyesight, and likewise does not tire or strain his body.
- * Occasionally, Obito is depicted using Kamui without activating his Mangekyō Sharingan.
- * In the anime, the Hizashi Hyūga of Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero uses a technique similar to Kamui.
- * The space-time ninjutsu of Shin Uchiha, Nue, Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki and Sarada Uchiha are similar in function to Kamui.
- * In Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker , there are 2 versions of Obito's close-range Kamui: for Obito, and for Kakashi Hatake (Double Sharingan).

## Drawbacks
- during early appearances, while using the "Tobi" persona, Obito commonly pretended to be hurt or feel pain to confuse opponents.

## Notes
- Sometimes he does this in order to escape attacks, other times he does this in order to travel long distances.
- Everything he's touching, including his clothes, weapons and even other people will become intangible too.
- In time, he becomes accurate enough to teleport projectiles mid-flight, and later can make the barrier space large enough to teleport the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path's head.
- originally his limit is three times in a day, but this is later increased to an unspecified number.
- The power of both eyes also grants the user the ability to generate large portals that can allow others to travel through.
- Opening portals to those other dimensions requires a great deal of chakra, so much that users will likely need another person's assistance.
- This possibly stemmed from Obito's access to Hashirama Senju's cells augmenting his body, similar to them reducing Kotoamatsukami's recharge time from 10 years to one day, or extending how long a Sharingan user can keep Izanagi active.
- * Although teleporting objects from a distance is the left eye's ability, Obito uses the right eye to teleport Kaguya's All-Killing Ash Bones.
- ** This was likely done to prevent tension from building regarding Tobi's identity until just before his identity was revealed rather than being an actual ability of Obito's.
