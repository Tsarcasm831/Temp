## Notes
- Unlike the standard Clone Technique, these water clones are physically real, allowing them to interact with others and even perform the same jutsu as the user.
- Although a single water clone can be quite challenging to a standard genin, In the anime, the clones can alternatively disperse into a mist that act as a smokescreen to briefly covers the area.
- Water clones cannot travel too far from their user's location, meaning that running away is a viable option against them.
- This aside, water clones are useful as support and diversions.
