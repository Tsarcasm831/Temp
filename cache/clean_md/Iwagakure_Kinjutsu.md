## Summary
This is an unnamed kinjutsu which was passed down through generations in Iwagakure. By doing so the object can be shaped, animated, and controlled remotely.

## Notes
- On command, the object's size can also be manipulated â€” from nano-sized to gigantic heights.
- Once the user infuses their chakra into an object, it can become a source of origin for a technique.
- Deidara stole this technique in his quest to find the ultimate art and used it in conjunction with his Explosion Release kekkei genkai to infuse explosive chakra into clay, creating his signature Explosive Clay.
- Sekiei, a fabrication, was given both the nature transformation and this technique to utilise it in the same way.
