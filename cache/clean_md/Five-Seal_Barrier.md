# Five-Seal Barrier

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Barrier Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Nagato
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user connects five tags to each other using their own chakra. One of the tags is applied to a central location that the user wishes to prevent access to, while the other four are applied to surfaces in the surrounding area.

## Counters / Defenses
- This means having a sensor among those intending to breach a Five-Seal Barrier can save a significant amount of time.

## Notes
- So long as at least one of the tags remains in place, a barrier will be created over the central location that prevents it from being opened or in any way physically damaged.
- Those wishing to remove the barrier are advised to break into two small teams for maximum efficiency: one team focuses on removing the four surrounding tags, while the second team removes the central tag and immediately afterwards storms the stronghold.
