## Summary
This technique performed by first getting a fix on the target's chakra signature, then bringing their hands together to form a triangle-shape with them, keeping the fingers on each hand together above while the thumbs are pointed down. Focusing their efforts through the centre of the hands gesture, the user can scan the area for that particular target.

## Notes
