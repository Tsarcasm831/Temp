## Summary
Rasa causes a considerable quantity of Gold Dust to erupt from beneath the surface, by placing both of his palms onto the ground directly in front of him, before manipulating the resulting substance into a wave of tidal proportions. The amount of dust produced by this ability is comparable to that of the sand used during Gaara's Quicksand Waterfall Flow technique, but as gold is the heavier of the two, the former was capable of nullifying the latter when they clashed.
