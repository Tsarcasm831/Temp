## Summary
With the body modifications of the Asura Path, the user can open parts of their body to reveal a cannon that fires a massive blast of chakra with explosive power strong enough to devastate an entire area. When Nagato used this through his path, he opened the body's head to reveal the chakra cannon, and when he did so himself after his reincarnation, he used an arm-mounted cannon.
