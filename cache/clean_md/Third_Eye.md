## Summary
Gaara creates an eye out of sand that hovers in the air wherever it's created. Gaara connects the eye with his optic nerve using chakra, allowing him to see whatever is in the Third Eye's field of vision.

## Notes
- The eye gives Gaara a useful method of performing surveillance without being noticed; In Gaara Hiden , Gaara is capable of creating several Third Eyes and connect each eye to his optical nerve at once, allowing him to observe things from multiple angles simultaneously.
- Rasa makes his Third Eye out of Gold Dust.
- Rasa, like Gaara, must close one of his eyes before he can see through the Third Eye.
- In the anime, Shinki has displayed the ability of creating multiple Third Eyes with his Iron Sand, without the need of closing one of his, though it quickly drains his chakra.
- * In Naruto: ShippÅ«den episode 410, the eye is depicted as blue, matching Gaara's eye colour.
