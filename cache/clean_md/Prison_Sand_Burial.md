# Prison Sand Burial

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Gaara
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Using his chakra, Gaara breaks open the earth and uses his sand to pull a target up to two hundred metres underground; targets are dragged down so quickly that they cannot escape it. Because of the depth that they're buried at, targets are rendered unable to move even a finger.

## Notes
- Gaara then applies additional pressure to them with the sand, crushing them to death.
- T≈ç no Sho likens this technique to the larva pits of antlions.
