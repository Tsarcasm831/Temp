## Summary
The Liger Bomb is a certain-kill technique used by the Fourth Raikage. Then, using his extreme strength, he smashes them head first onto the ground in what resembles a powerbomb manoeuvre.

## Notes

- Darui noted that nobody has ever survived this attack before, and had Sasuke Uchiha not used his Susanoo to cushion the impact, he would have been killed by it.
- The impact of this technique was strong enough to snap the ribs of Sasuke's Susanoo.
- Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as Raiga Bakudan .
- * "Liger Bomb" is also the name of an attack used in professional wrestling, most notably by Jushin "Thunder" Liger.
- A Liger Bomb is, a sit down variation, of the common powerbomb.
