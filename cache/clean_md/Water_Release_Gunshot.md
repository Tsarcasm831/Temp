## Summary
The user creates water in their body using chakra. The user then spits the water from their mouth as orb-shaped projectiles, whose destructive potential are determined by how much chakra is placed in them.

## Notes
- The orbs travel quickly towards the target, dealing extensive damage upon impact.
- When Gamabunta uses this technique, the water orbs are not only especially large, but are made more lethal because they're shot while he's airborne, thereby adding the force of gravity to their power.
