## Summary
A tailed beast uses its massive chakra reserve to turn a roar into a powerful force of pressure and destruction. When Naruto was in control of Kurama's power, he too could produce these shockwaves by roaring.

## Counters / Defenses
- Initially, these shockwaves could deflect projectiles, fracture infrastructure and destroy some ninjutsu,

When used by Kurama itself, it's powerful enough to completely disperse powerful attacks like the Sage Art: Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan, and even knock back fully transformed tailed beasts.

## Notes
- When used by the Ten-Tails with a single shockwave, it can destroy mountains while tearing up the landscape for miles in its initial form, as well as use it to initiate its Tenpenchii in its mature form after it recovers from its emaciated state.
- * There have been times while using Kurama's chakra where Naruto has produced shockwaves or even explosions through punches or waves of his arms.
- However, since these instances have never been indicated to involve firing chakra, it's unclear if they were produced with this technique or through sheer speed.
