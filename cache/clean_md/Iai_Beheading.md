## Summary
Adhering to the principles of Iaidō, the user performs a quick and powerful slash with their sword in order to cut the intended target, before immediately re-sheathing the blade afterwards. When used by Mifune, the technique was strong enough to cleanly slice open the large head of Hanzō's salamander, Ibuse.
