## Summary
The user spits a volley of small fireballs into the air; at a glance, it can appear as though there was only one fireball that then burst into many. The many small flames move wildly through the area, potentially mesmerising targets as they're surrounded.

- Shuriken can be hidden within the flames, not only making them more deadly upon impact but also, by controlling the flames' movements, giving users a means of controlling the shuriken as well.

## Notes
- In fact, when the technique was first used in chapter 46, it was written as .
