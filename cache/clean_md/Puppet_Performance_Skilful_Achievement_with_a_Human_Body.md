## Summary
A puppet performance technique where chakra threads are attached to various spots on a person's body; the head, torso, both arms, and both legs. The person being manipulated gains the ability to not only use their own techniques, but the skills of the puppeteer as well.

## Counters / Defenses
- However, a highly skilled user can control the target by force if the person is severely weakened or damaged, rendering them unable to resist.

## Drawbacks
- In Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage , Kankurō was able to combine this technique with his knowledge of the chakra pathway system to develop the ability to use the chakra threads to disrupt his victim's flow of chakra, thus hindering their ability to use techniques and causing them extreme pain.

## Notes
