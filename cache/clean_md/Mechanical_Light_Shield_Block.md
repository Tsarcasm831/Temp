# Mechanical Light Shield Block

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Defensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Chiyo, Kankurō~~puppet~Sasori, Mecha-Naruto~game
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
This technique is a chakra-based shield that is used to defend against attacks. This form of defence is usually installed into puppets, where the user opens their segmented arms and radiates chakra through to form a light blue, thin shield.

## Counters / Defenses
- Chiyo installed this shield into her own arm and into the puppets designed like Sasori's parents.

## Notes
- While it is powerful enough to block iron sand constructs, the sand will still seep into the joints of the puppets, which will restrict their movements, and thereby, stop the technique from functioning.
- Kankurō later installed one into Sasori's puppet body.
