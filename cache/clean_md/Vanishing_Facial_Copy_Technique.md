# Vanishing Facial Copy Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Orochimaru, Kabuto Yakushi~anime
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
The user applies their hand to a target's face, allowing them to take the face and use it as their own. Because it's the actual face that they're using and not a disguise, the user runs no risk of being discovered due to imperfections or minor flaws.

## Notes
- The bodies of those whose faces have been stolen are, as a consequence, quite ghastly to look upon.
- Orochimaru can also remove the face himself when he no longer needs it.
