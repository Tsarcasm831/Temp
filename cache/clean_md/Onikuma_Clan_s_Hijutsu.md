# Onikuma Clan's Hijutsu

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden~Onikuma Clan, Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Users: Enko Onikuma
- Media: Anime

## Summary
A unique Hiden jutsu that is passed down to members of the Onikuma clan. Described as a "possession-type" Summoning Technique, the technique mutates the users arms into a beast-like form granting them enhanced strength and allowing them to stretch similarly to the Soft Physique Modification.

## Usage
- Similar to JÅ«go's Clan's Kekkei Genkai, this technique can prove mentally unstable at times as it can cause the user to assume a more bestial form when they become emotionally vulnerable resulting in them losing complete control over the technique.
- Until she understood what brought these fits, it required her team-mates to tranquillise her when she lost control.

## Notes
- Enko Onikuma was prone to fits of rage which were triggered by feelings of loneliness caused by other's fear of her due to the jutsu's appearance.
