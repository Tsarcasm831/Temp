## Summary
A , whereby Gengetsu, in tandem with his Giant Clam, is able to manifest realistic mirages by manipulating the light reflecting off the steam that it produces. Gengetsu's illusions can last indefinitely.

## Notes
- According to Gengetsu, the only method to end the technique is to defeat the real clam, stopping it from producing steam.
- But as the creature itself remains camouflaged within the mirage, this is no easy task, even if the summoner is providing beneficial advice.
