## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Gaara
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
After a target has been engulfed by Quicksand Waterfall Flow, Gaara slams his hands onto the sand and activates this technique. As with the regular Sand Waterfall Funeral, the sand compresses upon and grinds down the target, though on a far greater scale than the regular version.

## Notes
- The large volume of sand used in the Quicksand Waterfall Flow is flattened out and the target is repeatedly squeezed, preventing them from moving and ultimately crushing them to death.
- Kimimaro is able to survive this technique only because of fortification to his bones.
