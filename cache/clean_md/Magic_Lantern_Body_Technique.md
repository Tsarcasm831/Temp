## Summary
The Akatsuki members sit down and send out , converted into chakra. These thought waves are then picked up by Pain, acting as a kind of control tower.

## Counters / Defenses
- These virtual images looked like the member they represented, the only difference being that they are standing up with their hands in a seal.

## Drawbacks
- While Pain is relaying the members' thoughts, they can have conversation and use varying techniques.

## Notes
- This technique amplifies the thought waves and broadcasts them to a specific location through illusionary bodies.
- The illusionary bodies differ from being mere reflections.
- The images were also transparent, except for the eyes.
- The anime depicted the images refracting an array of spectral colours, much like a rainbow.
- Their bodies distort and flicker, as if receiving electronic interference, and the members' voices are altered the same way.
