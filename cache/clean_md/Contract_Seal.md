# Contract Seal

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Fūinjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Minato Namikaze, Hashirama Senju~anime
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
When the user implements this fūinjutsu on a summoner, it removes any direct control the summoner has over a summoned creature. Close contact appears to be required for the implementation of the seal.

## Usage
- Minato Namikaze used this technique to wrest a Sharingan-controlled Kurama from Tobi's control.
- Doing this however, seems to negate the time limit that a controlled summoning creature is in the present place.

## Counters / Defenses
- Though the Contract Seal removes the summoner's ability to control its summon, it does not give the user of the fūinjutsu the ability to control the summon in turn.
