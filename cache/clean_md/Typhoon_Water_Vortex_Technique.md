## Summary
This cooperation ninjutsu uses the wild rotation of the thrown Wind Release: Rasengan to swallow up the water current created by the Water Release: Tearing Torrent, creating a large quantity of water vapour. Once invoked, a strong wind whirls around inside the highly concentrated mist, turning it into a solid barrier.

## Usage
- Of course, the mist can be used as a smokescreen when escaping, but the confusion it creates can also be used, for instance, to launch a surprise attack.

## Notes
- The mist created by the violent rotation of the Rasengan also has the effect of taking away the enemy's field of vision.
- If one can use multiple natures, it is possible to perform this technique alone.
