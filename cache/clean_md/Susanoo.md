## Summary
Susanoo is the strongest ability available to those who have awakened the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes, having been passed down through the Uchiha Clan's generations. It manifests as a gigantic, humanoid avatar made of the user's chakra, which surrounds them and fights on their behalf.

## Usage
- The latter characteristic can be used against the user; if an opponent can bypass Susanoo, however slightly, and latch onto them, they may be forcibly pulled out of Susanoo.
- It can be used as a projectile and can explode into massive pillars on lightning large enough to engulf Kurama.
- Susanoo inherited his father's sword Totsuka no Tsurugi, which Izanagi used to kill his newborn son, Kagu-Tsuchi after his birth burned his mother, Izanami, to death.
- After his exile for his relentless harassment of Amaterasu, Susanoo redeemed himself when he used Totsuka to slay the serpent Yamata no Orochi and obtained the Sword of Kusanagi from the monster's corpse.

## Counters / Defenses
- This connection allows Susanoo to be a shield against physical attacks, one that becomes more difficult to penetrate as it is manifested more fully.
- Sasuke uses the chakra from Jūgo's Sage Transformation to make a , with markings reminiscent of the Cursed Seal of Heaven spreading across it.
- The Sword of Totsuka is an ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade that, in addition to standard cutting, can seal anyone it pierces, trapping them in a genjutsu-like "world of drunken dreams" for all eternity.
- In its primary left hand, Itachi's Susanoo wielded the Yata Mirror, a shield that can change its nature depending on the attack it receives, thus nullifying it.
- Its primary weapon, though, is a bow, manifested on the wrist of its left arm; the bow can double as a shield, a function that becomes more visually apparent in its armoured form.
- Curiously, his armoured Susanoo appeared to always form the Tiger hand seal with its front hands, and was the largest of its variation.
- He could also use Susanoo: Blade of Yachihoko to absorb the chakra from all those affected by the Engraved Tsukuyomi in order to increase the size of his sword, and repair any damage to his Susanoo unlike other users, though doing so took some time.

## Drawbacks
- Sasuke Uchiha describes the sensation of using Susanoo as feeling pain in every cell in his body, which only increases over time of usage as well as at higher developmental stages.
- Being a Mangekyō Sharingan-based ability, it also places a strain on the user's eyes the more it is used, however, it is not actually necessary for one's Mangekyō Sharingan to be active while using Susanoo; in fact, Madara Uchiha is able to use it without any eyes at all.

## Notes
- By default, Susanoo is anchored to its user and they to it: in its less developed forms it will move around with the user; in its more completed forms the user will be suspended within Susanoo, being brought with it as it moves around.
- Although Susanoo is quite effective as a defence, it is able to distinguish in what it blocks.
- For example, the user can still perform jutsu while within Susanoo, such attacks being able to pass through it to the outside without complications.
- Others can be brought within Susanoo with the user's permission, and users can likewise choose to leave Susanoo's protective structure.
- With continued mastery, Susanoo can have increased defensive capabilities even at its ribcage stage, as seen when A was able to crack a rib of Sasuke's Susanoo, but conversely, could not crack Madara's.
- If it is damaged, Susanoo does not regenerate and it can only be repaired either by advancing it to the next developmental stage or by dispersing it and then forming it anew.
- Also, Susanoo is also only able to defend against physical attacks, so they are still vulnerable to visual or auditory attacks for example.
- Additionally, unless the legs of the Susanoo are fully manifested, the user's still vulnerable to attacks from below.
- Susanoo draws on the user's chakra in large amounts so long as it is active.
- Practised users go through all the stages every time they manifest it, layering more advanced stages over earlier ones or stripping them away as is needed; they can choose to stop at any developmental stage.
- At its simplest level, users only manifest aspects of Susanoo's skeletal structure, such as a ribcage for basic defence or an arm for interacting with the surroundings.
- Once a full skeleton is made, musculature and, later, skin forms until finally a complete humanoid is shaped.
- In these early stages, typically only the upper half of Susanoo is materialised, with legs becoming common once it reaches its full humanoid form; however, not all Susanoo users can accomplish the latter feat.
- In its next stage, armour forms around the humanoid for further protection, causing it to resemble a yamabushi.
- In its final stage, users stabilise the chakra that comprises Susanoo to create a colossal form known as the , the ultimate ability of the Mangekyō Sharingan.
- In this state, Susanoo gains a tengu-like nose, wings for flight, and is clad with robes and ornate armour.
- This form is generally the size of a tailed beast, with the exception of Hagoromo's, which was roughly the size of the Ten-Tails.
- This form also possesses power comparable to that of a tailed beast, capable of levelling giant mountains and, when enhanced by Six Paths Chakra, small planetoids with ease.
- Users can also channel their own techniques into the Complete Body — Susanoo, as well as shape it around the Nine-Tails to improve its offensive and defensive capabilities.
- Users are able to mingle the chakra that makes Susanoo with chakra from other sources.
- He later stores the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, drastically improving its strength and causing lightning to emanate from its back.
- Some features are consistent, however, all Susanoo constructs are deviations of the Japanese tengu, and have two sets of arms — one of which can form wings as part of its Complete Body form — and six fingers on each of its hands.
- All Susanoo wield at least one sword.
- In its humanoid form, its face was framed by locks of hair, with an appendage on its chin reminiscent of a Pharaoh's false beard.
- When its armour was formed, Itachi's Susanoo resembled a long-nosed tengu and it wore a pair of magatama earrings.
- Itachi's Susanoo possessed a curved blade that resembled a dagger or tantō.
- He rarely used this, preferring his Sword of Totsuka, wielded in its primary right hand and sheathed in a sake jar held by its second right hand.
- According to Black Zetsu, the simultaneous use of the Sword of Totsuka and the Yata Mirror made Itachi essentially invincible.
- In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Itachi has an exclusive Complete Body — Susanoo form that retains the traits of his previous forms, including a retractable version of the Yata Mirror, and a broadsword version of the Sword of Totsuka.

- Because Sasuke's development has often been marked by intense feelings of hatred, his Susanoo is noted to be much darker in composition compared to Itachi's.
- Whereas Itachi's Susanoo appears relatively "normal", Sasuke's possesses demonic horns, a long appendage on its chin, and a malevolent grin.
- Its armoured form initially appears largely the same as Itachi's save for having jagged teeth around its hood.
- After Sasuke gains the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan, however, its appearance changes, the armour's mouth taking on a beak-like shape and generally becoming ghastly-looking.
- In its Complete Body form, Sasuke's Susanoo has a helmet that features a long tengu nose, two spikes over each eye, a slit stretching across its mouth, three gaps on each of its cheeks and one additional gap on its chin.
- Like Madara's, it is massive, comparable in size to Kurama after Naruto Uzumaki got Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's chakra.
- Because of his Rinnegan, Sasuke can use the wings of his Complete Body Susanoo to block out the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi (and in Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections the Engraved Tsukuyomi).
- When drawing on the power of the tailed beasts, the armour of his so-called is reduced somewhat, exposing the humanoid within.
- This form is capable of generating a sword instead of having it form alongside the Complete Body — Susanoo, enabling him to catch opponents off guard.
- Sasuke's Susanoo has a blade in all its forms: a sabre in its developmental forms, an ōdachi in its humanoid form, wielded with its second right hand, and finally a pair of katana in its Complete Body form.
- Weapon properties can be augmented, either with black flames in its armoured form or lightning in its Complete Body state.
- Sasuke is able to perform techniques through his Susanoo, such as Chidori and Great Fireball Technique.

- His Susanoo was made up of two entirely different sides that were conjoined along their spine, both of which had a distinct face: the front face had elongated canine teeth in its lower jaw bracket and two tusks growing from said jaw, while the back face had similarly elongated canine teeth in its upper jaw bracket and a single horn protruding from its forehead.
- In its armoured form, the usual tengu-like armour splits from its forehead down, revealing Susanoo's eyes while obscuring the rest of its face.
- In its Complete Body form, its head gained a long tengu nose and two lines running down from its mouth to its chin area, as well as hair which was tied up at the sides, and dwarfs a mountain-sized meteor that he had brought down on the Fourth Division during the war show it was at least several hundred meters tall.
- Madara's Susanoo wielded distinct, undulating blades that resembled kris, held in the right hand of each side.
