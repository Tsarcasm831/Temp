## Summary
The Mysterious Peacock Method is a trademark technique of Hoshigakure and utilises chakra-enriching radiation produced by a meteorite that fell 200 years prior to the start of the series. This chakra is easily manipulated into various shapes to create techniques, making it one of the most versatile jutsu around.

## Usage
- MPM Destroy.png| : The chakra feathers are used to attack.
- MPM Apparition.PNG|If the user is close to death, they can use their remaining chakra to draw a symbol in the ground which allows them to temporarily resurrect themselves as a ghost-like apparition to even the score with whoever killed them.
- However, this may not be a true technique, as Akahoshi was under control of the meteorite and did not form the dragon himself.

## Counters / Defenses
- This apparition can seemingly deflect attacks, use any moves it could in life and be cloned through another's use of the Shadow Clone Technique.

## Notes
- These techniques are honed through Star Training, which requires the ninja to spend large amounts of time focusing on their chakra and meditating in the presence of the meteorite.
- Even for those who master the technique, there is still a high chance that their body will slowly weaken and eventually perish.
- At least three people (including Sumaru's father, Hotarubi, who dies from extensive exposure), show severe physical trauma.
- Natsuhi is the only known person who endured the training with no side effecs.
- This led the Third Hoshikage to ban the training.
- With the meteor's destruction after Akahoshi's defeat, the training became lost forever.
- The chakra that the beast is made of is dense enough to repel shuriken thrown at it.
- MPM Join.png| : Combines two chakra beasts into one larger beast.
- MPM Wings.png| : The chakra feathers form wings strong enough to support a normal sized human in short flight.
- MPM Choke.png|The chakra feathers turn into ropes to ensnare and strangle a target.
- MPM Dragon.png| : After implanting the star into himself, Akahoshi formed a dragon that could shoot blasts of star chakra at the opponent, and can also grow wings to increase its power.
- MPM Rope.png| : The user extends their chakra into a binding rope that cannot be cut.
- MPM Chakra Predation.png| : The user steals star chakra from another comrade and devours it, making their own stronger.
