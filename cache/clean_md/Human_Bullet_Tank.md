## Summary
This is a "showy" taijutsu unique to members of the Akimichi clan. Due to their increased weight and the force of their rotation, most obstacles are pulverised upon contact.

## Notes
- Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,

How the Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes.
- In Part I, when Chōji Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.
- * In the anime, Nagare modelled his Assimilation: Rock Tank after this technique.
- * Neji uses a similar technique in Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles .
