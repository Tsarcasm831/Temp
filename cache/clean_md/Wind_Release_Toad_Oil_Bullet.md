## Summary
This technique is the wind-natured upgrade of the Toad Oil Bullet technique, similar in principle to the Water Release: Water Gun. It was ad-libbed from Naruto's and Gamatatsu's Wind Release: Toad Gun technique, using toad oil instead of water.

## Notes
- Naruto moulds his wind-natured chakra, while Gamatatsu moulds his own chakra into the oil in his mouth.
- On command Gamatatsu will expel the oil from his mouth, and combine it with the wind chakra that Naruto channels into Gamatatsu's body, creating a powerful and fast stream of toad oil, which spreads to cover a much larger area but maintaining a powerful striking force due to the wind-natured chakra.
- This technique sets up for Gamakichi's Fire Release: Flame Bullet technique, which combine to produce the Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet technique.
