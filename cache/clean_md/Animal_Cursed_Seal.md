# Animal Cursed Seal

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Kinjutsu, Juinjutsu, Senjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Mizuki
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
This is a unique cursed seal applied by Orochimaru, still in its experimental stages, and therefore was incomplete and unstable. As with any cursed seal, the chosen person would faint upon acquiring the seal from apparent pain.

## Counters / Defenses
- This cursed seal is not the source of its power; rather, it serves as a blueprint to create a potion that will grant the drinker power akin to an actual cursed seal.
- By activating several hand seals, the ingredient names will appear in the corresponding slot sections of the seal.
- The seal is applied onto Mizuki's right forearm.
- By pressing a button on the edge of the stone tablet, the slots would release the liquified ingredients down the channels, where they would mix together at different sequences, and when all of them meet at the end to the bottom of the tablet and the potion itself is formed, the colour becomes a glowing crimson, similar to when the cursed seal patterns spread across a person's body.
- Unique as this cursed seal is, even the markings gained differs from the typical ones: this seal's first stage does not spread in a pattern across the user's body, but instead gives Mizuki stripes on his arms and face alone; the second stage does not give him a beige-skin mutation, but instead a bipedal-animal form.
- * In Naruto Mobile, when entering the second level of the seal, Mizuki releases a stream of red chakra throughout his body, similar to the JinchÅ«riki's chakra cloak, increasing his speed and attacks.

## Notes
- Said potion consists of genetic information of animals which would be combined with the drinker's body to release an explosive amount of power.
- The ingredients may be found in the Nara clan's laboratory, which is hidden deep within the mountains.
- The potion can then be formed in a secret room in a mountainous cavern: ingredients are placed and mixed on a giant tablet matching that of the tattoo.
- Tsunade believed that no ordinary shinobi would be able to copy the method of this mixture, and that the skills of an artisan would be required.
- The inside, however, consists of various ducts and slots, leading to a bottom slot at the "jaw".
- While the potion ingredients are grounded into liquid and poured into their respective slots, they each have a different colour.
- With his strengthened muscles, he was able to smash his opponents through solid ground and throw them to great distances.
- He also gained tremendous increase in speed, allowing him to overrun both Naruto Uzumaki and Iruka Umino with ease, appearing as a barely visible blur whenever he moved.
- Iruka also noted that Mizuki's chakra levels rose drastically.
- When the second level is reached, the user will gain specific characteristics of the animal, along with immense increases in their strength and abilities.
- Since Mizuki added the extracts of a tiger to the mix, he transformed into a bipedal tiger, with increase in strength, but a great drop in speed and sharpness in his attacks.
- Because the sudden burst of power places a huge burden on the cells, far beyond a body's limit, and the results will backfire, destroying the user's body.
- For Mizuki's case, the potion was incomplete when he drank it, so when the effects dissipated, he shrivelled up into a malnourished and powerless old man, and would have died if not for Tsunade's medical skills.
- Regardless, Mizuki lost all of his powers and could never be a ninja again.
- The stone table required to mix the ingredients is hidden under the stone floor, which requires a hidden chain switch, underneath the eighth wall tile on the right side from the entrance, to be pulled, to trigger the hydraulics to open the trapdoor and elevate the table.
