# Dance of the Seedling Fern

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Shikotsumyaku, Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Kabuto Yakushi, Kimimaro
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
While underground, Kimimaro produces as many as ten thousand blades of bone that sprout from the earth. Because of how quickly the bones appear from the ground, how wide an area they cover, and how high into the air they extend, this technique can do extensive amounts of damage, killing indiscriminately.

## Counters / Defenses
- If any of his targets should somehow avoid this technique, Kimimaro, by activating the second level of his cursed seal, is able to merge with the bone blades.

## Notes
- He can then appear from any of them, ideally, one at the target's blindspot so that he can launch a finishing attack.
- * This is the only known Shikotsumyaku technique to be classified as ninjutsu, rather than taijutsu.
