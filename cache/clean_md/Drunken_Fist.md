# Drunken Fist

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Taijutsu, Fighting Style
- Class: Offensive, Defensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Rock Lee
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
This is a style of taijutsu that is only possible while the user is very drunk. Because they are intoxicated, users move irregularly and erratically: they attack with no warning and defend with unconventional motions.

## Counters / Defenses
- * In English translations of the series, the sake Lee drinks is referred to as either a "potion" or "elixir" to avoid references to alcohol.

## Notes
- Users have no conscious awareness of what actions they'll take, which also means opponents can't predict what they'll do.
- In Rock Lee's case, he also becomes extremely belligerent while drunk, thereby adding to his opponent's confusion because of how polite he usually is.
- Since he's already very gifted with taijutsu, Lee is extremely destructive in his drunken state; Lee returns to normal shortly afterwards.
- Lee seems to have no memory of his actions while drunk, or at least he can't understand his hangover.
- In the anime, Lee developed a variant called Seasickness Fist, where he makes use of nausea caused by seasickness to overcome the fact he can't drink alcohol.
- ** Despite this, elixir is typically made of 40-60% alcohol.
- * Drunken Fist Lee is playable in some of the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja video games as a transformation character.
- The transformation only lasts for a set amount of time.
- * In a censored English version, Lee's cheeks are not red.
- However in the uncensored English they remain red.
