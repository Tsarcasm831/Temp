# Cloak of Invisibility Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, General skill
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Magire Kakuremino~anime,
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game

## Summary
The user covers themselves with a cloak that has a colour and pattern matching the nearby surroundings, concealing their presence by seamlessly blending in. The user can then gather intel from their position or wait for an opportunity to stage an ambush on unsuspecting targets.

## Notes
- Although skilled ninja can make effective use of this technique, unskilled ninja can be particularly ineffective; during his time as an Academy Student, Konohamaru Sarutobi routinely used poor disguises, such as trying to blend in with a fence using a horizontal pattern rather than a vertical one.
