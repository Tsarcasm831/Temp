## Summary
The user applies their hand to a wounded part of the body and sends chakra into it, accelerating the body's natural healing abilities. Although its most obvious use is as a way of treating external injuries, it can also be used for internal illnesses.

## Notes
- Users must be careful to only use as much chakra as is needed for the specific injury.
- If too much chakra is sent into the body, this can disrupt the body's circulation, putting it into a comatose state.
- When Sarada Uchiha practised it on a fish, she sent too much chakra and caused it to eventually burn up.
- The anime states that the different hidden villages have all developed their own applications for this technique that are unknown to other villages; in Kirigakure's case, its medics can use it as a remedy for seasickness.
- In this technique's case, it is a reference to the secret of immortality the legendary real-life sages allegedly had.
- * This technique is possibly derived from the real-life spiritual practice of Reiki, commonly known as palm- or hands-on-healing.
- * Kabuto Yakushi has been shown using the Mystical Palm Technique from a short distance away, without directly touching the person he's healing.
- ** Sakura is likewise shown healing an injury to herself, seemingly without using her hands at all.
