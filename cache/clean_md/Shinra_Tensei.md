## Summary
Shinra Tensei is a technique used through the Deva Path of the Rinnegan, said to be its pinnacle ability. Users can narrow the repulsion's direction, only pushing away things on certain sides so that nearby allies will be unaffected.

## Usage
- This repulsive force is most commonly created around the user as a defence, repelling nearby opponents or incoming ninjutsu; it can also be used to disperse ninjutsu that have already struck the user, such as Amaterasu.

## Counters / Defenses
- At its standard strength, opponents can resist Shinra Tensei by securing themselves to the ground: coating their feet with chakra to increase traction, digging in deeply enough to counter repulsion, or grouping together to minimise the repulsive force's influence.

## Notes
- Alternatively, the repulsive force can be created away from the user, destroying whatever is at the designated location.
- Shinra Tensei's strength and area of effect are determined by how much chakra is used.
- In its typical usage, it repels only within a few feet's distance and has enough force to destroy earthen constructs.
- Shinra Tensei also exerts a recoil on the user.
- If the opponent can withstand the repulsive force and force the user to use enough force, they can turn Shinra Tensei against the user.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble , an enhanced, "Full Throttle" version of the technique called can be performed.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Sasuke can use Shinra Tensei while he is in his Complete Body — Susanoo form.
- * In the manga, Kaguya attacks Naruto and his clones with a repulsive force by extending her hand, but the name of the jutsu used is not mentioned.
- In the Jump Force game, where the ability is seen again, it is confirmed to be Shinra Tensei.
- * In the anime, Momoshiki repels a burst of Fūma Shuriken through a jutsu with repulsive capabilities, but does not mention its name.
- Even so, the jutsu in question has the same characteristics as Shinra Tensei, is used through the Rinnegan and Momoshiki has demonstrated that he meets the necessary requirements (being able to manipulate the five basic nature transformations).
