## Summary
The is the origin of the unique techniques bestowed by the Rinnegan. Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.

## Usage
- * The , which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.
- * The , which allows the user to summon a wide variety of creatures.

## Counters / Defenses
- * The , which is capable of absorbing all forms of chakra, including most ninjutsu.
- Each of these "paths" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives.

## Drawbacks
- Nagato, who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of black receivers.
- The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.
- As the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble , a technique called "Six Paths Technique" is used by Nagato's Six Paths of Pain.

## Notes
- Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:

* The , which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.
- * The , which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.
- * The , through which the user can call upon the King of Hell.
- * The , with which the user is able to preside over life and death.
- These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations.
- However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale Shinra Tensei, or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of Chibaku Tensei.
- In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.
- It also does not seem that the user is able to change the Path being utilised by each body, as once each of Nagato's Six Paths were taken down, he could not channel any of their powers through the remaining vessels.
- While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate Saṃsāra, the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.
- The Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term Tīrthika , refers to any doctrine that "treads the outer path" to enlightenment.
- This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the , and is thus considered misguided and heretical.
- He then created a black rod out of his will and told Obito to use it when he performed the Six Paths Technique.
- In this variant, Nagato generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor.
- An enhanced, "Full Throttle" version of the technique called can also be performed.
