## Summary
Possession is an unique ability possessed by Black Zetsu allows it to take advantage of its malleable body to coat itself over a target. This technique is mainly used to restrict the movement of the target by coating a target's body, and forcibly make them do its bidding by directly channelling its will through them.

## Usage
- By using this technique, Black Zetsu can perform various feats including controlling the target, and even stabilising their life force allowing them to live following a mortally-taxing event.

## Counters / Defenses
- Once in contact with a target, they can also absorb the target's chakra and transfer it to others, One drawback of this technique, is that if the target has a strong enough will as in the case of Obito they can suppress Black Zetsu's influence, and take advantage of Black Zetsu being attached to them.

## Notes
- In possession of the target's body, Black Zetsu is also able to use target's techniques, as well as any other ability they may possess.
