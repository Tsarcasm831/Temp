## Summary
The Night Guy is a forbidden taijutsu of the highest level and can only be performed after opening all Eight Gates. Shouting , he then dashes forward at such an extreme speed that the space ahead of the user is distorted, making it impossible for the target to defend against it.

## Notes
- Guy then deals an immensely powerful kick which carries such force that it is capable of obliterating the target's body, as well as creating a devastating shock wave linear to the kick.
- The damage itself was so great that even Madara Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki feared for his life.
- The recoil was such that it completely shattered the bones in Guy's striking leg.
- As a result of opening the Eight Gates, the fatal repercussions of doing so soon left Guy on the brink of death; slowly turning into ash, crumbling from the immense discharge of his chakra.
- * While the other Eight Gates techniques combine a time of the day with an animal, this technique's name swaps the animal's name with Guy's own name, indicating that Guy became the dragon himself.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , this jutsu is used in conjunction with Evening Elephant.
