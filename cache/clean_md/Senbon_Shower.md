## Summary
This technique requires special umbrellas that have been spring-loaded with hundreds of senbon. The user opens several of these umbrellas and spins them into the air.

## Usage
- As they spin, they release the combined thousands of senbon, which the user controls with their chakra.
- The user directs the senbon to fall upon the target, striking them all over like rain; to control so many senbon at once requires a great deal of training.

## Counters / Defenses
- Despite all this, Gaara's Shield of Sand completely protected him from damage.

## Notes
- Because of how many senbon there are, evading all of them is almost impossible.
- Furthermore, each senbon is supposed to be able to penetrate a five millimetre-thick steel plate.
- They just jump into the air and shower the enemy with a hail of senbon.
