## Summary
The Flying Thunder God Technique is a space–time ninjutsu originally developed by Tobirama Senju. It was later recreated by Boruto Uzumaki.

## Usage
- Together, they develop the Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique, which allows them to switch places with each other in combat to set-up different manoeuvres.
- During their lives, both developed their own variants of the Flying Thunder God: Tobirama had the Flying Thunder God Slash, which he used to stab opponents the instant he teleported to their side; Minato had Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder, which created a barrier in front of him that teleported incoming attacks to a different location.
- Though it produces nearly identical results it is technically different enough to be considered an entirely separate technique, and has more limitations.
- * In video games, Minato's use of the Flying Thunder God Technique creates a yellow flash, in reference to his nickname.

## Counters / Defenses
- During the Third Shinobi World War, Minato's extensive usage of the Flying Thunder God led to his moniker as "Konoha's Yellow Flash": Minato's ability to dodge A's Lightning Release Chakra Mode led A to dub Minato the fastest ninja who ever lived.
- This may suggest the reasoning as to why the technique is restricted towards a seal, because lightning is attracted to lightning rods.
- * The Flying Thunder God Technique has sometimes been referred to as the Body Flicker Technique,
* Although it's been said that the technique formula can't be removed, its marking has disappeared from individuals that have tailed beasts sealed into them and extracted from them.
- Tobirama's is more reminiscent of the formula used for seals – a random assortment of Kanji, Hindi script, and other symbols.

## Notes
- There is no limit to how many targets can be marked with technique formulas, as Minato Namikaze routinely uses dozens at a time.
- By entering a dimensional void, users can instantly teleport to a technique formula's location whenever they please, regardless of distance, or different dimension.
- To an onlooker, it may look like the Body Flicker Technique, but the Flying Thunder God actually has more in common with the Summoning Technique.
- but this requires additional chakra to do; particularly large objects can require so much chakra as to place a limit on how far away the user is able to teleport.
- Users can choose to teleport to a different location than the objects, or they can teleport objects without teleporting themselves.
- In combat situations, the Flying Thunder God can most effectively be used by marking an opponent's body with the technique formula, allowing the user to teleport to them at anytime: when the marked opponent tries to attack, the user can attack them first; Tō no Sho likens this to a juinjutsu, in that anyone marked with the technique formula is essentially sentenced to death.
- Both Tobirama and Minato were famed as the fastest shinobi during their lifetimes.
- While both were very fast on their own, the Flying Thunder God also contributed to their fame.
- When both Tobirama and Minato are revived during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tobirama was able to link himself with Minato's Flying Thunder God network, allowing him to teleport to the latter's technique formulas.
- Approximately two decades later, Boruto Uzumaki would take inspiration from his grandfather and use his inherent Ōtsutsuki teleportation ability to devise an imitation of the ninjutsu.
- * In the anime, Minato's technique formula appears to say 忍愛之剣, made up of the kanji for , , , and .
- * Originally, before Tobirama's second revival, the Flying Thunder God technique was said to be Minato's original technique, but it was then retconned to him learning it.
