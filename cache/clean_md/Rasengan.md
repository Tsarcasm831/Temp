## Summary
The Rasengan is a jutsu that takes form as a spinning ball of chakra, invented by Minato Namikaze. Because his lover, Kushina Uzumaki, was a jinchūriki, she would inevitably be deployed to fight opponents who would use Tailed Beast Balls against her.

## Usage
- This is by far the most difficult of the three steps because of how refined the user's chakra control must be.

## Counters / Defenses
- No hand seals are involved, in theory making it easy to learn and use, an assessment that Sasuke Uchiha agrees with after comparing the two.
- It can be useful to know in which direction one's chakra naturally spins, in order to avoid impeding oneself.

## Notes
- Minato therefore wanted to develop a technique that Kushina could use to match against those opponents, which also worked with her chakra volume as a jinchūriki.
- Minato struggled with the original concepts for the technique, as they were either too weak or too unstable for use.
- It was only from a conversation with Jiraiya that Minato thought of a way to make the technique usable.
- Because of Jiraiya's inspiration, Minato wanted to call the technique , but both Jiraiya and Kushina felt it was too long and lame.
- Kushina suggested "Rasengan" instead, which Minato agreed was a better name.
- Minato would continue refining the Rasengan, ultimately taking three years of development time to perfect it.
- The Rasengan is an application of shape transformation, where chakra emitted from the palm is rotated in multiple directions simultaneously to contain it within a sphere.
- If users thrust the Rasengan into targets, they can be propelled away from the user until they eventually collide with some obstacle.
- The Rasengan's various attributes have earned it recognition as the pinnacle of shape transformation.
- The Rasengan is in principle a simple application of shape transformation, but manipulating the motion of chakra in so many directions at once makes it extremely difficult to learn in practice.
- Additionally, as the technique is simply a mass of chakra, the technique is primarily suited for users with very high reserves of chakra.
- For this reason, Jiraiya breaks up the process into three steps when he teaches it to Naruto Uzumaki.
- who in turn later uses them when he teaches it to Boruto Uzumaki:
# Rotation - the user learns to spin their chakra in multiple directions at the same time.
- Users may be given a water balloon while they practice, to help them mark their progress by the churning water.
- The step is completed when users are able to burst the water balloon with their chakra.
- In theory this should be done with one hand, but Naruto initially uses chakra from both of his hands to increase the agitation, thus saving time.
- and in fact they may end up injuring themselves in the process of destroying the ball.
- # Containment - the user must combine the first two steps into a contained sphere.
- To help in this regard, users may be given a balloon to help them visualise the intended shape; if the balloon is popped or otherwise moves, mastery is not yet achieved.
- Konohamaru by the time he begins leading Team 7.
- Once learned, the Rasengan appears largely identical from one user to the next.
- The only potential difference is its size: when Boruto first learns to use the Rasengan, it's noted to be quite small.
- With greater proficiency, the size of a user's Rasengan grows to be about the size of their hand.
- He is eventually able to overcome this obstacle by using a second shadow clone to provide the nature transformation while he and another shadow clone form the Rasengan.
- This ultimately leads to the creation of the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, which is most notable for its ability to be thrown.
- Years later, Boruto unknowingly adds his own lightning-nature to his Rasengan, which causes it to turn invisible if thrown, potentially lowering an opponent's guard before it strikes them.
- It is fundamentally the same as the normal version, but the addition of natural energy into the mix the users chakra makes it notably stronger.
- For Naruto, it is while using Sage Mode that he is first able to throw the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken,

## Tailed Beast Influence

Naruto, as a jinchūriki, can use the Nine-Tails' chakra to assist in using the Rasengan.
- While using a version 1 cloak in Part I, he makes a Rasengan without the aid of a shadow clone, using the cloak itself to contain it.
- Due to the Nine-Tails' influence, this Rasengan is darker in colour and much stronger.
- Different video games have called it , , , and .
- After learning to use the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in Part II, Naruto uses chakra arms in place of a shadow clone to help him create the Rasengan.
- it is unknown if he succeeded.
- * In the anime, if used underwater, the rotation force of the Rasengan is capable of creating a whirlpool.
- * The anime shows Naruto being able to throw the Rasengan, something that is later established to require special training.
- * Katasuke uses this technique through his Shinobi Gauntlet.
- * In Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 , Jiraiya spews fire onto his Rasengan, creating the Fire Release: Great Flame Rasengan.
- * Jump Super Stars is one of the few video games where Part I Naruto is able to access his non-clone-refined version of his Rasengan, dubbed as .
- ** Likewise also in both the first 2 Uzumaki Chronicles games, Naruto can perform a version of the Rasengan without a clone enhancing it (holding down the input in the second game does involve the clone and turns it into a "True Rasengan/Spiralling Sphere" with merely an increased damage multiplier and hitbox duration).
- *** The video game Battle Stadium D.O.N.
- also curiously does not have a clone assist Naruto in the formation of the technique.
- * The Rasengan's appearance resembles Kūatsuken, a technique from the Ninku series.
