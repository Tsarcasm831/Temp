## Summary
The user expels a large glob of lava from their mouth, which quickly solidifies into a hollow ball that can be used to protect an object by surrounding it with the durable rubber-like material. The properties of this substance mean that it can both absorb and dissipate the force behind a blow when struck, resulting in it either deforming or bouncing upon impact.

## Usage
- As projectiles, he can control them remotely and they continuously gain momentum when bouncing off surfaces.

## Notes
- A skilled user of this technique, such as Dodai, is capable of making it appear as if they were intending to protect an object or individual within the sphere, when in fact they merely use the ball as a distraction in order to occupy an enemy, while instead covertly withdrawing the item in question from the ball during its formation.
- Kary큰's rubber balls, dubbed , are darker in colour and far more solid.
- Used offensively for ranged attacks, Kary큰's spheres can vary in size, from being hand held to rivalling the size of a house.
- The damage each sphere can deal is proportionate to the amount of chakra put into the orbs.
- In the first case, he places a small ball in front of him and then kicks it forcefully towards the opponent, causing the ball to act as a projectile and hit the opponent multiple times, ricocheting off walls.
- In the second case, he enters a much larger ball and jumps inside it, crushing the opponent from above with the weight of the ball.
- ** In his victory pose, Dodai is also able to spin small balls around his palm, just as Kary큰 did.
