## Summary
The Dead Demon Consuming Seal is a sealing technique developed by the Uzumaki clan to call upon the power of the Shinigami. Its very existence is so secret that even Orochimaru knew nothing about it.

## Counters / Defenses
- the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm.
- It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.
- he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.
- The target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.
- With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.
- He is able to make better use of the new body's arms, but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.
- * Tō no Sho lists the Dead Demon Consuming Seal as having a range of up to five meters.

## Drawbacks
- Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.

## Notes
- Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.
- While the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,
* When Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.
- instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.
- Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.
- Souls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using .
- To use, an individual wears the Shinigami Mask, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami.
- If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed.
- However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again.
- With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.
- When Minato uses it against the Nine-Tails, he does so from significantly further away.
- * During his discussion with Kushina on how to deal with the Nine-Tails, Minato stated: .
- What he meant by this is unclear.
