## Summary
The Mind Body Switch Technique is the signature technique of the Yamanaka clan. Their consciousness moves slowly towards the target and travels in a straight line.

## Usage
- When their consciousness does successfully make it to the target, the user supplants the target's mind and takes total control of their body.

## Counters / Defenses
- This isn't necessarily an issue in one-on-one encounters, but when facing multiple opponents this leaves their body vulnerable to attack.
- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , Ino uses a different hand seal to perform this technique.

## Drawbacks
- To prevent this from happening, the Mind Body Switch should only be used against targets that are stationary or that are restrained.

## Notes
- If the user misses their target, it will take several minutes for their consciousness to find its way back to their own body.
- The Mind Body Switch is ideal for intelligence-gathering, and in fact that's why it was originally created; Users can take advantage of the target's physical abilities, such as a bird's flight to better recon an area.
- Users can also perform their own jutsu while possessing another, notably their sensory skills.
- While possessing another's body, users can communicate with their targets.
- Ordinarily, the Mind Body Switch lasts until the user chooses to release it.
- Targets with strong wills can force users from their body, something that becomes easier to do if the user is low on chakra.
- While a user is possessing a target, their own body is left inert.
- Furthermore, any damage the possessed body receives is done to their original body as well.
- It is for this reason that Yamanaka are so often teamed with members of the Akimichi and Nara clans; the Akimichi keeps opponents at a distance, and Nara can use their shadow to manipulate the Yamanaka's body.
- * Rin no Sho lists the Mind Body Switch Technique as having a range of up to ten metres.
- * In the anime, Ino was unable to use this technique on Sora when he was in a version 1 form, as Sora's consciousness was swallowed by the beast's demonic chakra.
- The manga later shows her using it successfully against a version 2 Kinkaku, who maintained his consciousness.
- * In Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles , Ino uses a variation of the technique called , which switches the minds of two separate targets, instead of her own.
