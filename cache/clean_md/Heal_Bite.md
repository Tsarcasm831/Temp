# Heal Bite

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Karin, Karin's Mother~anime
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
Through biting and consuming the user's chakra, they can heal the injuries of others, as well as themselves. This technique, however, rapidly depletes the user's own chakra reserves, leaving them with a presumably permanent bite mark after each use.

## Notes
- Due to the technique's accelerated depletion of chakra, it is dangerous for one to use this ability too regularly as Karin normally refrains from doing so more than once a day.
- * This ability is uniquely tied to the user’s chakra’s specific characteristics, not to a jutsu that can be willingly used.
