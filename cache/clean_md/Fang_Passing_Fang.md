## Summary
An Inuzuka and their ninken companion both perform the Passing Fang, whereby they rotate their bodies and deliver a series of rapid body blows to a target. In order to coordinate their attacks, thus ensuring targets have no opportunity to defend themselves, Inuzuka and their ninken synchronise with each other as much as they can: breathing in unison; using the Four Legs Technique; using the Beast Human Clone.

## Notes
- As the users cross back and forth for this attack, the surrounding area is damaged as well, crushing rocks and shaving sections off the ground.
- * In the Naruto: Clash of Ninja series, Kakashi performs his own version of this technique.
