## Summary
The caster uses their sand to create gigantic hands or claws, which can be used for multiple purposes including crushing, capturing or restraining enemies and other targets. The brilliance of this technique is in the strength and sheer size of the constructs which rivals that of a tailed beast.

## Notes
- Once the arms lock onto its target, it is near impossible to break free, and one must resort to other methods.
- This technique was powerful enough to completely halt the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path's chains.
- Shinki’s usage of this technique incorporates Iron Sand, which he uses to surround his hand to strengthen his punches, or attach to more Iron Sand to act as arms, that can deliver a barrage of punches.
