## Summary
The highest form of Deidara's explosive clay and his , C0 is a suicide-bomb technique used as a last resort. Deidara reveals a mouth on his chest, which is stitched up.

## Notes
- After undoing the stitches, Deidara feeds it a large ball of clay.
- The mouth on his chest has a direct connection to his heart so a large amount of chakra is built up.
- It then kneads chakra directly from the meridians of the heart and keeps doing it without interruption until the moment of the explosion.
- His explosive chakra then manifests itself in his veins, flowing through his body.
- These "veins" then condense into a sphere that slowly cracks open and detonates, producing a unique explosion that covers a ten kilometre blast radius.
