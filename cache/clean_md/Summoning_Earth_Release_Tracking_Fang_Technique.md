- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Kakashi Hatake
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie

## Summary
When, for whatever reason, the user cannot find a target, they use this technique to summon a pack of ninken underground. The ninken use their superior sense of smell to track the target, converge on their location, and then all together burst from the ground and take hold with their fangs.

## Notes
- With the target captured in this way, the summoner can easily locate them and finish them off.
- When Haku later damages the scroll, the summoning is ended prematurely and the ninken disappear, thus releasing Zabuza.
- Such a threat is not present in the original Japanese.
