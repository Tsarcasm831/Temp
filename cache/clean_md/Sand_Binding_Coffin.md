# Sand Binding Coffin

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Gaara, Shinki~anime,
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game

## Summary
Using the sand he keeps stored in his Sand Gourd, Gaara immobilises his targets and captures them. Because the sand is naturally malleable, most of the target's usual methods for defence or escape become ineffective once they've been encased by it.

## Notes
- They can only wait until Gaara releases or kills them.
- * In the anime, Nagare modelled his Assimilation: Sand Binding Coffin after this technique.
