## Summary
Amaterasu is a Mangekyō Sharingan dōjutsu, and the highest level of Fire Release. Said to represent the , Amaterasu is the antipode to Tsukuyomi.

## Usage
- Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks.
- Because of the ability of his right Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke can control and shape the flames of Amaterasu using Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi.

## Counters / Defenses
- In most situations, this makes Amaterasu impossible to avoid.
- However, with enough speed, it is possible to avoid, dodge, or intercept the jutsu after it has been cast.
- Amaterasu does not ordinarily require hand seals to be performed, though Sasuke Uchiha once used the Tiger hand seal, which is common for fire techniques.
- This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person.
- Other defensive options are pushing the flames away, absorbing them through the Rinnegan, Kāma absorption, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.
- While impractical as a defence, Amaterasu can also be sealed.

## Drawbacks
- Use of this technique puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed.

## Notes
- Said to be "the fires from hell" and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Throughout the series some objects have shown a degree of imperviousness to the flames, such as Gaara's chakra-infused sand and Naruto's Version 1 chakra cloak.
- Befitting their description as never disappearing and immortal, Amaterasu's flames cannot be extinguished through most conventional means and will continue burning until their target is completely incinerated; only the user can put out the flames.
- Though the user can make Amaterasu incinerate things near-instantly when focusing on it, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly normally, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body part(s) before it spreads.
- Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, was born from the left eye of Izanagi when he performed the cleansing ritual after escaping the underworld.
