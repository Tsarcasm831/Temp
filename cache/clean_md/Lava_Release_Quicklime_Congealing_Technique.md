## Summary
This technique makes use of the Lava Release kekkei genkai where the user expels a large quantity of quicklime from their mouth, capable of inflicting damage to an opponent. This ability can also be manipulated in order to restrict the intended target's movements, as after the initial blast the remnants of the substance can act in a similar manner to quick-drying cement.

## Notes
- However, the technique requires the addition of water to set off the necessary reaction to make the substance harden.
- This can be easily achieved through the use of a Water Release technique, which can also serve to increase the area covered by the substance, thus further increasing the potential range of the technique.
