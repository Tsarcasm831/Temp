# Lightning Release: Lightning Beast Tracking Fang

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Lightning Release
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Kakashi Hatake
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Kakashi forms a Lightning Cutter in his hand and launches it at the opponent in the form a hound. The hound is highly fast and its movements are unpredictable, making it is very difficult to avoid.

## Usage
- As Kakashi's hand remains connected to the hound by a cord of lightning, adjusting the amount of chakra used for the technique allows him to freely manipulate its speed and range.

## Notes
- Raijū has many common representations, with a white and blue wolf sometimes engulfed in lightning being among them, akin to the form Kakashi's technique takes.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Kakashi can only use this technique if Lightning Cutter is selected as his Ninjutsu attack, as this technique serves as the Lightning Cutter's charged Ninjutsu attack in the game.
- * In multiple Storm titles, this technique is used in conjunction with Might Guy's Daytime Tiger as part of their Combination Ultimate Jutsu.
