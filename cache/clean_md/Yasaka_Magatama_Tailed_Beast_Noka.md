## Summary
This Cooperation Ninjutsu is a collaboration technique using the user's strongest long ranged techniques including Naruto's Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, Itachi's Yasaka Magatama, and Killer B's Tailed Beast Ball. The combination was only used once against Nagato, during which the users took advantage at not needing to aim their jutsu towards the target due to its gravitation pull.

## Notes
- On impact, the collaboration technique was strong enough to destroy Nagato's Chibaku Tensei.
