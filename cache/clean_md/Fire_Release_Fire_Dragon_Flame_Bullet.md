## Summary
After kneading chakra, the user breathes fire from their mouth. The flames are manipulated into the shape of a dragon and divided to strike the target from the left, right, and front all at once.

## Usage
- Because of the power of this technique, as well as the amount of skill it takes to control the flames, there are very few ninja who can perform it, the Third Hokage being one such user.

## Notes
- Unlike the Great Fireball, which covers a wide area, the Fire Dragon Flame Bullet makes focused strikes, quickly reducing targets to ash upon contact.
- * In the anime, the Shisui Uchiha of Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook can use this technique.
