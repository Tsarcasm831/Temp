## Summary
This is a type of where an area is defined using a number of special tags. When the area is entered by an opponent, a barrier is created.

## Counters / Defenses
- Even if the tags are discovered, actually disarming them is very difficult, for which reason it's generally safer to simply avoid the area.

## Notes
- The barrier's properties vary depending on the tags used: To prevent the trap from being noticed, the individual tags are placed in hidden locations, such as the shade of trees.
- Shikaku Nara once forced his son, Shikamaru, to read a book that discussed this technique, which described it as "a high-class ninjutsu".
