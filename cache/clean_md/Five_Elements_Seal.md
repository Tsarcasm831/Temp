# Five Elements Seal

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Fūinjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Orochimaru
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Orochimaru gathers "wicked" chakra to his five fingertips, which he forcefully applies over another seal. When this Five Elements Seal, being of an odd number, is applied over the Four Symbols Seal, being of an even number, the Four Symbols Seal is disrupted because of the odd—even imbalance.

## Counters / Defenses
- In Naruto Uzumaki's case, he loses access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails - which the Four Symbols Seal keeps stored in his body - and furthermore makes it difficult for him to use his own.
- When Jiraiya is later shown removing the Five Elements Seal from Naruto, he is able to correctly guess that Orochimaru applied it in the first place, describing its use as "coarse".
