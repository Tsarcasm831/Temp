## Summary
The user spits a stream of water from their mouth at the ground, which circles around them and rises upward to create a wall. The water wall defends anyone within its perimeter from attack, with the wall's strength being determined by how much of the user's chakra is put into it.

## Usage
- Users control how long the wall lasts as well as how much water it's made with.

## Counters / Defenses
- In Sasuke Shinden , Sasuke Uchiha creates the Water Formation Wall around his allies rather than around himself, providing them a shield while he carries out other tasks.
- ** In the anime, when Tobirama uses this technique, a different and far more elaborate set of hand seals is used, involving a unique seal of the right hand cupping the left hand with a thumbs-up.

## Notes
- Because the water is clear, the wall doesn't obstruct the user's vision, allowing them to make their next move uninhibited.
- In the anime, the water can also be gathered midair, and dispersed in all directions as a form of fire-fighting, or shot from one's hand.
- * In some video games, such as Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations , Tobirama uses this technique offensively, sending geysers of water outward in front of him.
