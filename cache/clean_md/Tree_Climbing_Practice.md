## Summary
Tree Climbing Practice is a training method used to gain more skills with chakra control. This training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet, and using it to climb a tree without using one's hands.

## Counters / Defenses
- If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to fracture around the point of contact and the user will fall.

## Notes
- If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off.
- The concept of this exercise is similar to magnetics.
- This is evidenced when Sasuke was able to attract a kunai Naruto threw his direction to his feet and then throw it at an enemy by kicking the kunai while releasing his chakra's hold on the kunai.
