## Summary
The Rain Tiger at Will Technique is a contact-type perception ninjutsu, allowing one to freely manipulate rain infused with the user's own chakra. During this technique, the falling raindrops are closely linked to Pain's senses.

## Counters / Defenses
- The rain will keep on falling until Pain uses the seal to cancel it.

## Drawbacks
- The detection of the rain, however, is not specific as Pain can only know if someone has entered the vicinity of the rain but not where specifically they are.
- When Pain is away from Amegakure, he always uses this technique to keep a close eye on the village.
- It keeps a very close guard on its cubs, watches vigilantly for an opportunity to catch its prey, and walks great distances to patrol its territory; all a reference to how Pain uses this technique to vigilantly watch over the village.

## Notes
- When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected.
- Upon knowing an intruder has entered the rain's vicinity, he needs someone who specialises in covering large areas to find the intruder's specific location.
- He also made it rain every Sunday.
- Assuming that no one in the village knows about the sensory nature of this technique apart from Nagato and Konan, outsiders will think the rain is a natural occurrence and will not be aware they will be detected once the raindrops fall upon them.
