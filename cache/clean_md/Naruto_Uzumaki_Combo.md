## Summary
Naruto creates four shadow clones to assist him for this technique. The clones kick or punch the target into the air, each yelling "U-ZU-MA-KI" ("NA-RU-TO" in some English translations) as they do so as the real Naruto himself leaps off a clone to chase after the target.

## Notes
- While both the target and Naruto himself are airborne, Naruto finishes with a , sending them back towards the ground as he yells out the rest of the technique's name.
- Naruto modelled this manoeuvre after Sasuke Uchiha's Lion Combo, increasing its lethality by combining the Lion Combo's taijutsu with the shadow clones' ninjutsu.
