# Shadow Senbon

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu,
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Kin Tsuchi
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
A simple technique using senbon, the user throws senbon with bells attached and senbon without bells at the same time. The intention is that the opponent will only react to the sound of the bells and won't notice the silent senbon, getting hit by these.

## Notes
- However, if the opponent recognises the trick it becomes easy to evade, as they simply need to focus on how many senbon were actually thrown.
- Kin Tsuchi makes a more advanced use of this technique by attaching strings to the thrown bells and ringing them from unexpected positions, confusing and distracting her opponent long enough for her to attack.
