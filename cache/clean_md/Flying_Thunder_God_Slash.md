## Summary
A technique combining the use of a bladed weapon and space–time ninjutsu. The user teleports to a marked target, with weapon in hand, to instantaneously deliver a swift, devastating slash to his opponent.

## Counters / Defenses
- In the anime, Tobirama used a marked kunai hidden with other thrown kunai, allowing him to attack a target that dodged his projectile attack.

## Notes
- Because of the speed of the technique's execution, not even an individual wielding the Sharingan — a dōjutsu capable of predicting movement — has enough reaction time to defend themselves against this technique, especially if the user is already physically fast.
