## Summary
Using this technique causes a target or targets to be physically immobilised, as though they've been tied down with invisible steel ropes. Because it's a relatively simple technique, even genin should be able to perform it.

## Drawbacks
- However, the strength of the binding varies significantly from one skill level to the next, so a mere genin could not hope to restrain the same targets that an Anbu could, for instance.

## Notes
- The Temporary Paralysis Technique is a useful way to stop an opponent from attacking or, alternatively, make an opponent easier to attack.
