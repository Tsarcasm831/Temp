## Quick Facts

- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Wasabi Izuno
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
Passed down in the Izuno Clan, the user uses a scroll to bring forth the chakra shroud of a giant cat. This technique displays prodigious strength, capable of smashing a massive stone boulder with a single blow.

## Notes
- The sculpture depicts a cat (traditionally a Japanese Bobtail) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed—many times at the entrance—in shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
- * While the clan's most powerful jutsu, its lack of successful use until Wasabi's made many in the clan doubt its existence.
