## Summary
The Flaming Arrow of Amazing Ability is a technique used by Nagato through the Asura Path. It has enough destructive power to easily break through thick bedrock.

## Usage
- As the hand portion is protected with chakra, it allows it to remain unscathed.

## Notes
- When the attack is complete, the hand is drawn back like a magnet by chakra in the wrist, reattaching itself.
- The first and most common way is the idiomatic way: "an amazing or remarkable ability".
- The second way is by translating the kanji directly: "mysterious or suspicious arm", making the name a pun.
