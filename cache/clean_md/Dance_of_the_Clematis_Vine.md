## Summary
When Kimimaro enters the second level of his cursed seal, his spine grows longer to give him a tail-like appendage. For this technique, Kimimaro removes that spine to use as a weapon.

## Notes
- Cartilage between the individual vertebrae makes the spine flexible for use as a whip, and the cartilage can be stretched further to increase the whip's range.
- It's a perennial ivy that grows flowers coloured white or deep purple.
