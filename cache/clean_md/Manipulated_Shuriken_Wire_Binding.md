# Manipulated Shuriken Wire Binding

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu,
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Media: Anime

## Summary
By using shuriken with wire strings attached to them, the user can set a trap for their target. Using the shuriken to spread and set the wires around, they can position them as to bind their target, requiring only to trigger a change of position of the set wires, such as cutting one of them, causing the others to rearrange.

## Notes
- If a shinobi is highly perceptive, such as a Sharingan user, it is possible to use one's own projectiles to change the course of the wired shuriken as the trap is set, making it so the one setting the trap is immobilised instead.
