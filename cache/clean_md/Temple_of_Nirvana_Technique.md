## Summary
Everybody within an area is subjected to the same illusion: many white feathers fluttering down from the sky. If a given target sees enough of these feathers fall, they will fall into a deep sleep.

## Notes
- Only by dispelling the genjutsu, such as with the Genjutsu Cancel, can victims regain consciousness.
- If targets are attentive enough, they can similarly dispel the genjutsu themselves before the feathers have lulled them to sleep.
- It is known as the highest point of meditation.
