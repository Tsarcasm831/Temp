## Summary
The Lightning Cutter is the special name for Kakashi Hatake's Chidori. Although this indicates greater finesse with Kakashi's Lightning Cutter than exists with the standard Chidori, it isn't clear how they differ because they are performed in fundamentally the same way: both concentrate lightning chakra in the hand; both are used to rapidly pierce targets; both cannot be safely used without the Sharingan.

## Usage
- Like the Chidori, the Lightning Cutter requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, placing a limit on how many times it can be used per day.

## Counters / Defenses
- During Part II, Kakashi demonstrates several new uses for the Lightning Cutter, such as forming one in each hand to counteract powerful lightning attacks.
- He combines this usage with Kamui, causing her counterattacks to pass through him harmlessly.
- To counter this, in Kakashi Hiden , Kakashi developed a new signature technique, Lightning Release: Purple Electricity, which functions similarly to Lightning Cutter, albeit can be used safely without the Sharingan.
- * In Kakashi Retsuden , Kakashi encounters Hakubi Shin, a rogue ninja from Konohagakure who claims to be able to use the Lightning Cutter.

## Notes
- When Deidara refers to Sasuke Uchiha's jutsu as Lightning Cutter, Sasuke corrects him and explains that his jutsu is technically only a Chidori.
- In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day, which he increases to an unspecified number in Part II.
- On another occasion, he links his Lightning Cutter with one of his shadow clone's, using the arc of electricity to cut through multiple targets.
- He can also flow it into kunai, enhancing its slicing power and giving him a method of throwing the Lightning Cutter.
- * The name Raikiri comes from a story about famous samurai, Tachibana Dōsetsu: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called .
- One day, while taking shelter from the rain under a tree, a bolt of lightning struck him.
- However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the Thunder God inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive.
- After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to .
- * In the anime, the Lightning Cutter is usually depicted as blue, whereas the Chidori is depicted as white.
- Although the technique is similar in appearance and how it's used, it's only an imitation that lacks the Lightning Cutter's raw power.
- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire , when this technique was copied by Hiruko, he used the electrical energy to surge around the area, increasing the range of damage.
- * In the crossover comic series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Naruto , Kakashi performs a cooperation ninjutsu with Leonardo utilising the Lightning Cutter called Lightning Katana .
