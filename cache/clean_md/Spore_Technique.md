# Spore Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques, Chakra Absorption Techniques
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Black Zetsu, White Zetsu
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
White Zetsu is able to plant spore-sized parasite clones onto the bodies of others for the purpose of remotely monitoring them. As these clones parasitise their victim's chakra and have no chakra of their own, they cannot be detected by standard sensory abilities.

## Counters / Defenses
- The absorbed chakra can be transferred to another individual by establishing physical contact with them.
- The spores can also activate in order to shield their host from harm, or be forced into activation and expelled from their host's body if that individual takes in senjutsu chakra.

## Notes
- Once activated via time-delay, the parasite clones suddenly expand, restricting their victim's movements and stealing greater amounts of chakra.
