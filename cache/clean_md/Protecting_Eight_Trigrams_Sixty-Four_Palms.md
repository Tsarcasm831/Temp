## Quick Facts
- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Byakugan, Hiden~Hyūga Clan, Taijutsu,
- Class: Offensive, Defensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Hinata Hyūga
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
Created by Hinata, this is a highly versatile technique which affords both offensive and defensive capabilities whereby she emits a constant stream of chakra from her palms, which are formed into extremely thin, sharp, blades. While using this technique offensively, Hinata shapes the chakra into thin, sharp, flexible blades allowing her to hit hundreds of targets with extreme precision and can cut smaller targets, like bees, into pieces.

## Usage
- When used defensively, Hinata creates much larger, stronger, more flexible, arc-shaped chakra blades that spread out across her entire attack range, effectively forming a barricade between herself and her opponents, rebuffing even the largest and smallest of targets.
- With the addition of Hinata's flexibility, the technique creates an "absolute defence" effect similar to that of the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven, though the cutting nature of the chakra prevents any outside force from restricting it.

## Notes
- * This technique did not make a début in the Naruto manga, but did make an appearance in the manga and anime spin-off, Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles .
