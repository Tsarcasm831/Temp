# Crow Clone Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Itachi Uchiha
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
This is a clone technique utilised by Itachi Uchiha. Because it uses crows as a medium, it requires less chakra than the normal Shadow Clone Technique, while still being able to perform techniques.

## Counters / Defenses
- When the crow clone is defeated, the crows can regroup to form a new clone immediately, or failing that, can be used to blind the opponent, leaving them open to a counter-attack.

## Notes
- The dozens of crows then come together to form the body of a clone.
- The same crows of the dispersed clone can regroup and form a new clone immediately.
- When the chakra projected by the user is severed, the crows disperse, though the user is still able to continue to speak through it.
