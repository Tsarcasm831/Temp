## Summary
A portal opens up in the sky, spewing down a large amount of mud onto the opponent. It has been used in conjunction with the Lightning Release: Sixteen Pillar Bind to create a giant oven around the opponent and the Fire Release: Fired Pottery Technique to ignite the oven, hardening the mud that's covering the opponent and immobilising them.
