## Summary
The Steaming Danger Tyranny is Gengetsu Hōzuki's . The water in the clone is surrounded by a thin layer of oil and due to this structure, the clone's temperature can easily be altered from cold to hot and vice-versa.

## Usage
- This high-speed movement also allows it to heat up very quickly and to more easily inflict damage using an axe-like liquid blade that it is able to form on its arm.

## Notes
- When it exerts itself, the outer layer of oil heats up and evaporates the water inside.
- As the internal pressure builds, the clone expands until it violently explodes and the water vapour is released.
- The force of the explosion is great enough to completely destroy even durable constructs.
- This vapour then cools down as it rises and as a result, turns into hail that cools the clone, causing it to shrink to its original size and start the entire process again.
- Despite its constantly increasing size, the clone itself remains very fast throughout the technique, enough to elude even Gaara's chakra-infused sand.
- Throughout the duration of this technique, the Mizukage becomes weakened and vulnerable.
- * The continuous cycle of this attack is very similar to that of the water cycle.
