## Summary
An extremely versatile move, this technique uses chakra to activate the roots in the ground and, using the user of the technique as a reference point, makes wooden pillars appear from left and right. The wooden pillars join together in a dome-shape with the user at the centre.

## Notes
- In the case that the user confronts the enemy at a short distance, the enemy can be locked up inside the dome, catching the enemy in a double sided attack.
- Furthermore, it can function as an easy shelter against an enemy's long-distance attacks, like the shockwave created from Naruto Uzumaki in his Version 2 state.
