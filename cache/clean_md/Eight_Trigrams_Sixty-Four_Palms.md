## Summary
This is a secret taijutsu of the Hyūga clan's main house, traditionally only known by the head of the clan and the clan's heir. Neji Hyūga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius.

## Counters / Defenses
- As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks.

## Notes
- Using their Byakugan's near-360° field of vision, the Hyūga envisions themselves within the centre of an Eight Trigrams symbol.
- The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu.
- Those sixty-four tenketsu are subsequently blocked, stopping the flow of chakra within the target's body and making it difficult for them to move.
- The sixty-four strikes are broken into six smaller sets.
- Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster.
- The last set, during which thirty-two strikes are performed, is especially difficult, demanding great resolve and a strong step forward to pull off.
- The six sets of strikes are:
#Two consecutive strikes.
- #Two more consecutive strikes, totalling four.
- #Four consecutive strikes, totalling eight.
- #Eight consecutive strikes, totalling sixteen.
- #Sixteen consecutive strikes, totalling thirty-two.
- #Thirty-two consecutive strikes, totalling sixty four.
