## Summary
The Big Ball Rasenshuriken is a larger variant of the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. The sphere in the technique's centre is considerably larger compared to that of the Rasenshuriken's standard variant.

## Drawbacks
- When thrown it causes a tremendous wind sphere upon detonation that can be seen from several kilometres away, and is enough to even neutralise a reincarnated Madara Uchiha long enough to be restrained, while simultaneously destroying both of Hashirama's wood dragons.

## Notes
- The user can also keep adding chakra to the technique causing it to expand to enormous proportions.
- In this enormous version, Rasenshuriken shines very brightly in the dark.
