## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Water Release
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Long
- Users: Ao, Inoichi Yamanaka, Kakoi, Kussaku

## Summary
By forming a sphere of water, the user can use it to monitor chakra signatures in a given area. Individuals or groups are represented as varying-sized bubbles within the sphere, with larger chakra signatures having larger bubbles.

## Notes
- The sphere itself is not a great form of detection and needs on-the-field reports to locate targets that should be kept track of.
- When linked with a Sensing Barrier, this imprecision is mitigated somewhat.
