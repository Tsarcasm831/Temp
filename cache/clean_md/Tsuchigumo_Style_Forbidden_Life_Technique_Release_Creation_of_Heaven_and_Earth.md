## Summary
This technique releases the seal on the Fury technique and then accumulates natural energy from the earth and atmosphere to be used for the technique. The bearer of the seal acts as a passive vessel, continuously gathering natural energy, which makes it possible to use Fury without their cooperation.

## Notes
- * This technique is similar to senjutsu in that it also gathers natural energy.
- However, unlike Sage Mode, the chakra does not directly power the user's abilities.
