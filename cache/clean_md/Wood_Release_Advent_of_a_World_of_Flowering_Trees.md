## Summary
Taking advantage of the innate properties of Wood Release which allows the user to force trees to grow on any surface at a rapid pace, the user creates a dense forest of flowering trees. During the forest's formation, the user can have the branch restrain any target(s) that tries to attack the user before the formation of the forest is complete.

## Usage
- The user can also control where the pollen spreads so it does not affect them nor their comrades.

## Counters / Defenses
- With enough willpower, it is possible to regain consciousness, however, in order to counter the technique fully, either the trees themselves must be destroyed completely or the target must continue to remain elevated above the dispersed pollen.

## Notes
- The pollen produced by these flowers is then released into the atmosphere and when inhaled, renders any afflicted target unconscious.
- The pollen is also capable of penetrating Susanoo's defences.
