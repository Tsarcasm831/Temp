## Summary
The Iron Sand Gathering Assault is a technique which gathers a great volume of Iron Sand and compresses it into a high-density shape. The weight and size of these shapes are so great, they can easily shatter bedrock and break through most defences with a single hit.

## Usage
- This allows the user to create the best weapon for the fight, by taking into account the opponent's abilities and the surrounding environment.

|This giant block-like weapon can be used to crush its target with devastating power as a giant block that is used to crush the target.

## Notes
- Because the weapon is made out of Iron Sand, the shape can be whatever the user wants, and can even be changed during the fight.
- Since the Iron Sand generates a strong magnetic field, the opponent cannot use any metal weapons or tools.
- It can be spun to pick it up even more power, giving it a drill-like appearance.
- It can also be shaped into a thinner, but longer version of it to increase its range.
- The user can also hover them over their target to launch them down at any time with incredible speed.
