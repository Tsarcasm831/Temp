## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu, Clone Techniques, Kinjutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Naruto Uzumaki
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
After using the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, Naruto Uzumaki and his shadow clones simultaneously throw shuriken at a target. Because of how many shuriken there are and how many directions they're thrown from, the target, regardless of how skilled they may be, cannot reasonably dodge all of them.

## Usage
- This focus on the shuriken inevitably creates blind-spots in the target, which is the actual purpose of this technique: the many Narutos can focus on these blind-spots to execute additional attacks.

## Notes
- The four directions are the cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West.
- The eight directions are these four and their halfway points: North-East, South-East, South-West, and North-West.
