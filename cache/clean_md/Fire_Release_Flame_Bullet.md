## Summary
This technique is executed by the user gathering oil in their mouth which is created by chakra, spitting it out, and igniting it. This technique simply shoots a flame bullet at the enemy.

## Usage
- This allows the enemy to be stricken unaware, allowing the oil-containing flame bullet to burn them up completely.

## Notes
- If the amount of oil that is prepared is kept down, the time it takes to invoke the technique is reduced.
- It is also possible to shoot out a series of flame bullets by partitioning the oil, or a continuous flamethrower.
- If this technique is fired after covering the enemy with oil using the Toad Oil Bullet, it has the power to wound or kill.
- This also keeps down the consumption of chakra.
