## Summary
This is a high-level form of medical ninjutsu that only Tsunade has been shown to have mastered. Tsunade creates an electric field by giving her chakra the properties of electricity.

## Usage
- Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves.

## Notes
- When she strikes a target with her hand, the electricity pours into their nervous system and rearranges their body's signals.
- But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement other than what the brain intends.
- When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.
- * In Jump Ultimate Stars , Sakura uses this technique by charging chakra in her hand and thrusting the opponent with her palm, causing damage and leaving the target confused.
