## Summary
Covered in the Lightning Release Chakra Mode, A leaps from a high vantage point and performs a simple yet powerful horizontal chop on his opponent from above, seemingly using the momentum gained in the previous fall to increase the force behind his strike. In the event the attack isn't powerful enough to penetrate an opponent's defence, the attack can be used to push an opponent well into the ground to prevent them from escaping from another incoming attack.
