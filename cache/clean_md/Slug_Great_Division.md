# Slug Great Division

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Katsuyu
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Katsuyu, being a mollusk, has a body that is naturally difficult to grasp hold of, in turn granting it a natural defence. As an additional defence, it can, when it's being physically attacked, divide its body into countless smaller versions of itself, thus nullifying the attack.

## Notes
- The smaller divisions, each one a full-functioning Katsuyu, can recombine when they wish, restoring Katsuyu to its larger size.
- If a Katsuyu should be attacked again, it can just divide again, repeating the process indefinitely until the attacker gives up.
