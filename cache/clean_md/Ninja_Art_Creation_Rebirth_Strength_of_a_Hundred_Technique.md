## Summary
The Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique is a forbidden technique that is only accessible to those who have mastered the Creation Rebirth technique. The enhanced regeneration granted by this technique is so rapid that even the wounds that resulted from Tsunade being impaled by two gigantic swords were completely healed mere moments after their removal.

## Usage
- It represents the third eye which allows one to see past the mundane world and into the divine world.

## Counters / Defenses
- * According to Madara Uchiha, this technique is similar to Hashirama Senju's ability, in that it heals the user's injuries without requiring hand seals to activate.

## Notes
- As it builds on the Creation Rebirth, it shortens the user's lifespan.
- This technique's power can be temporarily transferred to another person upon physical contact, as seen when Sakura extended the technique's markings onto Obito Uchiha.
- This is a clear allusion to the diamond mark on the user's forehead.
