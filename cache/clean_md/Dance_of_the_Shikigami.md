## Summary
By converting her chakra into paper, Konan transforms her body (and clothing) into numerous sheets of paper; the initial creation and dispersal of the paper can mesmerise opponents. origami butterflies for spying, and clones for supplementary purposes.

## Notes
- She can create paper wings on her back to fly (though she can hover without them) and use them to shoot paper in rapid succession.
- She can also wrap her target in paper, restricting their movements and asphyxiating them.
- Konan's paper is affected in similar ways as normal paper: fire will burn it but she is later seen using her paper despite the rain.
- These spirits are often depicted as changing into small pieces of paper once harmed or finished with their task.
- In the name of this technique, the kanji for has been replaced with the kanji for , which is pronounced the same.
- This is likely done to emphasise the paper nature of Konan's shikigami and to point out the subtle difference between them and traditional shikigami.
- * Her ability to make wings out of paper mirrors her title as "God's Angel" in Amegakure.
