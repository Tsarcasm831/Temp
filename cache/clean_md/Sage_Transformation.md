## Summary
is a way of attaining Sage Mode, using a bodily reaction exhibited by members of Jūgo's clan. By exposing their special body fluids to natural energy, they gain increased physical capabilities and the ability to perform various shape-shifting feats.

## Counters / Defenses
- * In the anime, Tosaka "perfected" his Cursed Seal Device by attaining a sample of Jūgo's genetic material, granting him an inferior version of Sage Transformation.

## Notes
- Once transformed, common features include eyes with yellow irides and black sclerae, altered skin colour and longer hair (hair colour change may also occur in some users).
- A user of the Sage Transformation can transplant their flesh with anyone compatible with such experiments, in the events of a heavy injury, though this will cause the user's body to shrink in size and age.
- * Kabuto, having assimilated Jūgo's DNA, uses this transformation to enter Sage Mode.
- * Initially Mitsuki could only access this ability to enter Sage Mode subconsciously.
- Later in the anime, it was shown that he could do so freely.

- * While Orochimaru discovered the Ryūchi Cave and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, he was not able to use Sage Transformation to enter Sage Mode, since he lacked a compatible body.
