## Summary
The Wind Release: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken is a more advanced version of Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. Naruto used four hands to form the technique instead of three.

## Notes
- Much like the smaller variants, Naruto is able to throw this technique a considerable distance.
- It is powerful enough to break through a giant barrier.
- * In the anime, the nucleus-blade ratio of the Rasenshuriken itself was proportioned differently, being similar to a greatly enlarged Wind Release: Rasengan.
