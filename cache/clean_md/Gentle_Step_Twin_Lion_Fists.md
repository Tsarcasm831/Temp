## Summary
The Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists is a high-level secret Gentle Fist technique taught only to the main branch of the Hyūga clan. Doing so greatly increases range and destructive power.

## Usage
- It is an extremely difficult ability to learn, as the slightest mistake in chakra control will lead to failure, meaning it is a feat requiring the Byakugan.
- This technique can be used in conjunction with the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms.
- By expelling chakra from the tenketsu as an innate ability exclusive to the Hyūga, and using precise chakra control, Hinata was able to shape the chakra around her fists in the form of blue guardian lions, as witnessed by both Neji and Hanabi.

## Notes
- The lion heads drain the chakra network of those they touch.
- * In certain games, Hinata can use this technique as a ranged attack by launching the chakra lions directly at her opponent.
