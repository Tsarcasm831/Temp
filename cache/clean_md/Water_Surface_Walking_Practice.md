# Water Surface Walking Practice

## Quick Facts
- Classification: General skill
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie

## Summary
This training method is used to gain better chakra control. To do this, the user has to be emitting a constant stream of chakra from the bottom of their feet and using the repellent force to walk across the water's surface.

## Usage
- Furthermore, this technique allows its users to walk on sticky surfaces without being affected.

## Notes
- This technique is more difficult to master than the Tree Climbing Practice, because the amount of chakra that needs to be emitted changes constantly.
- It has also been shown that one can use their chakra to " skate " across the water surface, like an ice skater, instead of just walking or running.
- As Jiraiya noted, the more one trains this technique, the more they reach a state where they stand on water without even noticing it or basically even trying.
- It doesn't have to just be at the feet.
- A user under water can focus chakra on their hands or any other body part that makes contact with the water's surface.
- If they were submerged, they can climb atop the water as if they were climbing out of a pool.
