## Summary
This technique allows the user to make a shadow clone infused with lightning. Because it is a shadow clone, it is able to perform techniques and interact with the environment.

## Notes
- If the clone is injured, it will revert to its natural lightning-state, at the same time electrocuting whatever makes contact with it.
- Unlike a regular shadow clone, however, it does not send chakra back to the user upon reverting to lightning.
