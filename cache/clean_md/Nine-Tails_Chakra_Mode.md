## Summary
The Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is a unique form of transformation that is granted to the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails. The form's design differs between users and can even change over time, but certain features are consistent across all forms: two horns on their head, six magatama markings around their neck, some sort of prominent circular/swirl design over their stomach, and various other lines extending along their body.

## Usage
- Kurama is able to speak through this replica and can be granted control of it; His pupils become a combination of the two forms: the vertical fox-slits with the horizontal toad-slits.
- This mode allows Naruto to have high speed, dodging Isshiki's high speed rods, something Sasuke has trouble with even with his Sharingan.

## Counters / Defenses
- While using just the basic Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto Uzumaki is strong enough to defeat members of the White Zetsu Army with a single kick and fast enough to dodge the Fourth Raikage using his Lightning Release: Body Flicker Technique.
- Naruto is able to transfer his and Kurama's chakra to others, granting them tailless version 1-like chakra shrouds that greatly enhance their techniques: Hinata Hyūga, for example, is able to deflect one of the Ten-Tails' tails with a single Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm.
- Kakashi Hatake states that the power and volume of the transferred chakra is even greater than when Kurama earlier directly handed chakra to him, which had improved his Kamui at least three-fold.
- Naruto notes he can absorb natural energy more quickly than usual while in Kurama Mode.
- When Naruto uses the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with Six Paths Sage Mode, his abilities are pushed even further, demonstrated by him becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard and durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.

## Drawbacks
- Because Naruto "shelves" his own chakra in this form and instead draws on the Nine-Tails', his early uses of it come with a risk that the Nine-Tails will take that shelved chakra, resulting in Naruto's death.
- Naruto must, therefore, be careful of how long he uses the form for and how many shadow clones he creates, as doing too many only increases the risk.

## Notes
- Like all jinchūriki transformations, the user's physical abilities are enhanced while the mode is active, with greater enhancements coming from using more of the Nine-Tails' chakra.
- The chakra that surrounds the user also helps in protecting them from damage, allowing them to take lava and boil-based attacks and suffer only minor injuries.
- Naruto is even able to survive Tenpenchii because of his protective cloak, though the cloak itself is lost in the process.
- The user's scent and chakra signature also change.
- From the chakra that surrounds them, users are able to produce chakra arms as a way to interact with their surroundings or improve their manoeuvrability.
- Naruto primarily uses the arms to help him form the Rasengan and its variants, having the arms assist with the shape or nature transformation that he usually relies on shadow clones for.

- While using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, users' eyes become orange but their pupils remain the same.
- Like previous jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails, Naruto is able to sense negative emotions while he's in this form, seemingly regardless of distance or obstructions.
- He also releases a powerful life force while the mode is active, causing wood constructs to quickly mature into full-grown trees when he's nearby

Despite the passive abilities and enhancements he gains, Naruto's use of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is initially marked by limitations due to the Nine-Tails refusing to cooperate with him.
- This prevents him from using Tailed Beast Balls while in this form, though he is eventually able to create miniature versions.
- The Nine-Tails eventually stops trying to take Naruto's chakra, and soon after that, starts cooperating, removing these limitations.

- and tails.
- In The Last: Naruto the Movie , Naruto is shown isolating the Kurama Mode transformation to one hand.
- Despite Kurama's contribution, C claims the transferred chakra more closely resembles Naruto's own.
- Whereas other jinchūriki's Tailed Beast Modes cause them to fully transform into their respective tailed beast, Naruto and Minato's are instead an alteration of their earlier chakra cloaks changed to resemble Kurama: Naruto's is the same translucent golden colour as his earlier cloak, while Minato's is a much darker orange colour with both having similar black lines all across its body.
- Minato is able to enter this form directly from Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, while Naruto must initially first enter Kurama Mode.
- Naruto is initially limited to only using this form for five minutes because he hasn't perfected his bond with Kurama, and then again to some unspecified limit.
- While Tailed Beast Mode is active, Naruto and Minato hover within the construct's head.
- They can in fact allow others to enter the construct as well, extending its protection to them and allowing Kurama to heal their wounds and replenish their chakra.
- Because it isn't a proper transformation, Naruto and Minato can still use their other jutsu from within this form, such as the Rasengan and Shadow Clone Technique, and can even use the construct's tails as chakra arms.
- After meeting Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki during the Fourth Shinobi World War, these abilities are further augmented by the powers of the Six Paths Sage Mode and the Six Paths Senjutsu.

- After receiving Hagoromo's power, Naruto gains the ability to use the Six Paths Sage Mode, and the initial appearance of his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode while simultaneously using it changes: his body is coated in yellow chakra; a sort of circular design is featured prominently over his stomach; the whisker-like markings on his face become thicker to resemble the ☰ trigram; six magatama markings are present on or around his collar; various other dark designs appear along his body, sometimes densely enough to give the appearance that he's wearing a body suit beneath the yellow coat.
- A pattern consisting of a Rinnegan-like marking above nine magatama also appears on his back.
- His eyes become yellow and his skin does not glow along with the rest of his outfit when activated.
- However, these same features are absent in later uses: the back pattern being gone, and his chakra mode once again consisting of orange eyes and yellow glowing skin like his chakra modes before he met Hagoromo.
- The one consistent hallmark of Six Paths Sage Mode are Naruto's eyes: while his pupils maintain the cross of vertical fox-slits with horizontal toad-slats, there is no pigmentation around his eyes that would otherwise signify the standard Sage Mode.
- This form is known as .
- This mode allowed Naruto to use the Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken, which was able to match Sasuke's strongest attack and cause the Valley of the End and the surrounding area to be devastated.
- However, because it consumes a lot of the users' chakra, Naruto cannot maintain this form for as long.
- * Kurama's golden chakra and approximate age of a millennia evoke the , kitsune who gain golden fur upon growing their ninth tail and reaching 1,000 years of age.
- They become equivalent to kami and ascend to the heavens.
- * In the anime's Power arc, Naruto temporarily assumes an incomplete version of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode after breaking free from Kurama's influence.
- During his brief time in the form, Naruto is able to form an incomplete Tailed Beast Rasengan, use chakra arms, and enter an imperfect version of the Tailed Beast Mode, although it lacked legs and possessed only six tails.
- * When Minato first entered this mode, his bangs spiked upward and his chakra cloak gained horns similar to those of his son.
- His hairstyle, however, reverted to its original state in the latter part of chapter 639.
- * In the colourised versions of chapters 676 and 678 included in digital editions of Weekly Shōnen Jump , Naruto's skin in this mode was depicted as yellow and his eyes had orange irides, much like his previous transformations.
- Later illustrations coloured by Masashi Kishimoto instead depict Naruto with his original skin colour and yellow irides.
- The colouration was corrected in subsequent chapters and the Naruto: Colour Edition release of volume 71.
- * Hagoromo attributes the presence of Kurama's chakra alongside Indra's and Asura's to his emergence from Madara's lower body as the Ten-Tail's jinchūriki after Kaguya's restoration.
