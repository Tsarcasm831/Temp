The user expels high viscosity water to cover the ground. This stream of sticky liquid can be used to form an adhesive trap that will inhibit a person's mobility.

## Notes
- One can effectively reduce their enemy's area of activity with this technique, giving the user an advantage on the battlefield.
- The normal scope of this technique is normally just a few metres, but it is possible to make an entire pond of starch syrup.
- The syrup can be manipulated to move after it is created, being able to stick and travel up surfaces.
- It takes the form of a clear, thick, and most of all sticky liquid.
- It can be literally translated as "water candy", emphasising its likeness to water and explaining why it is used in a water release technique.
- * In an omake, it is shown that this technique's creation was inspired when Izumo knocked over a jar of syrup, which was previously being eaten plain by Kotetsu Hagane, and subsequently tripped in the sticky substance.
