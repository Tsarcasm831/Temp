# Six Paths Sage Mode

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Senjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Defensive, Supplementary
- Users: Naruto Uzumaki
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game, Movie canon

## Summary
is a divine transformation gifted by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki to those who have an iron faith and the will to never give up. It significantly enhances the user's powers and allows them to use a number of new techniques.

## Counters / Defenses
- This mode increases the user's physical parameters well above that of Sage Mode and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode,

When Naruto uses his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with his Six Paths Sage Mode, he can push his abilities even further, such as being able to levitate, becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard and slice off her right arm, even being durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.

- This state is indicated with Naruto's pupils consisting of a cross of vertical fox-slits with horizontal toad-slits, and there is no pigmentation around his eyes that would otherwise signify the standard Sage Mode.
- Since Naruto first awakened this power, he has always used it simultaneously with the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.
- Directly after obtaining Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's power, Naruto's eyes are yellow and later orange with the various chakra modes he uses after the war, just like his previous ones before meeting Hagoromo.
- "Six Paths Sage Mode" suggests it is a version of Sage Mode augmented with the Six Paths.
- "Sage of Six Paths Mode" would suggest it is named after Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, better known as the Sage of Six Paths.
- The original Japanese supports both translations, and in fact could intend for both meanings to be true.
- * In Shikamaru Hiden , it is suggested that having the chakra of all nine tailed beasts is also a requirement to obtain this mode.
- * In the colourised versions of chapters 676 and 678 included in digital editions of Weekly Shōnen Jump , Naruto's eyes in this mode were depicted with orange irides, much like his previous transformations.
- Later illustrations coloured by Masashi Kishimoto instead depict Naruto with yellow irides.
- The colouration was corrected in subsequent chapters and the Naruto: Colour Edition release of volume 71.
- * In VIZ Shonen Jump, Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode was attributed to the Six Paths Yang Power.
- However, this is not mentioned in the manga or the databooks.
- * In Boruto: Naruto Next Generations chapter 52, Naruto asked about the difference between "Baryon Mode" and "Kurama Mode and Sage of Six Paths Mode" to Kurama.
- It is suggested that he was using the latter forms when he fought Isshiki Ōtsutsuki.
