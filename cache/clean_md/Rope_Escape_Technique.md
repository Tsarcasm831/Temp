# Rope Escape Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, General skill
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: <!-- do NOT add anyone, everyone can do basic techniques -->
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
A tenet of shinobi is that they must escape any situation, no matter how difficult things may seem. Accordingly, this is the first jutsu taught in Konohagakure's Ninja Academy.

## Notes
- When the user is bound, they do what they can to escape, such as by finding a way to untie the knot or dislocating their joints in order to get free of the bindings.
- Although this is the most basic of the escape-based jutsu, it is still fairly complicated to perform.
