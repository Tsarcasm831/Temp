## Summary
This technique is a projection-type genjutsu used by Kara as a means of communication. All the images projected by this technique appear corporeal and even the immediate surroundings can be altered by the user.

## Notes
- Projecting themselves also gives the user awareness of the chosen location, allowing the user to monitor the surrounding area.
- Though the user's movement is sometimes seen reflected in their projection, this does not seem to be necessary in all uses.
