## Summary
Explosive Clay is the characteristic skill of Deidara, first used during his career as a terrorist bomber, and later as a member of Akatsuki. In order to pursue this view, as well as to apply it towards combat, Deidara feeds clay to one of his body's mouths – most commonly the mouth on his left palm – giving them shape and turning them into explosives.

## Usage
- This in turn brings the clay creation to life, which Deidara can control remotely depending on how large it was made: an average-sized bird can be sent flying at an opponent as an attack; a large bird can be used as a form of transportation, and once he reaches his destination he can send it flying at an opponent as an attack.
- The dragon also produces clay mines, which are used to force opponents to fight in a limited space.

## Counters / Defenses
- To detonate the clay, he makes the Seal of Confrontation and says .

## Notes
- The power and type of explosion is determined by the chakra that he applies to the clay.
- To make practical use of them, however, it is necessary that Deidara enlarge them.
- Low chakra reserves also place Deidara at a disadvantage, as his mouths will struggle to shape the clay into usable forms.
- Deidara's clay is all earth-based, meaning that opponents can defuse the explosives with Lightning Release.
- They are usually kept at a small size, making them ideal for sneak attacks or other covert operations.
