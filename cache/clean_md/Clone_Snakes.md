# Clone Snakes

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Kabuto Yakushi
- Media: Anime

## Summary
After implanting Orochimaru's DNA, Kabuto used some of his cells to develop a large amount of tiny snakes that multiply at a rapid rate and can merge into either a clone of another living being using a genetic sample or a larger serpent for combat. They also have incredible regenerative abilities.

## Notes
- Kabuto not only created a clone of Hidan using this technique, he also created one of Naruto with Kurama's chakra as well.
- However, for Hidan, the clone snakes have a short lifespan, with what they form into eventually suffering a cellular breakdown within 48 hours of existence.
