## Summary
Hashirama Senju creates a dense growth of trees, controlling how it grows using his chakra. The trees' life force is immense enough to split the earth as they sprout and further pierce through any other obstructions they encounter.

## Notes
- This growth is also fast enough that it can capture targets before they have a chance to escape.
- Hashirama used this technique to serve as a foundation for Konohagakure; none other than Hashirama have been capable of such a feat.
- Years later, he instead uses Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees, a similar yet smaller-scale version of this technique.
- This technique changed the last kanji from to , probably to reinforce the greatness of the forest created.
- * In T≈ç no Sho , this technique is classified as hiden instead of a kekkei genkai.
