## Notes
- With this puppet collection it is literally possible to use one puppet with each finger â€” each boasting a power matching a thousand puppets put together.
- However, to use all of these secret mechanisms demands extremely high-class expertise and skill.
- These ten puppets were created by the first puppeteer Monzaemon Chikamatsu and later came into Chiyo's possession, the use of which earned her great fame.
- The Chikamatsu Collection has terrifying prowess in taijutsu, ninjutsu, bukijutsu, and so on.
- Furthermore, as they can change their numbers by combining, the number of abilities they can show becomes even greater.
- The puppets were constructed in such a way that they all can work in tandem with each other both offensively and defensively.
- It always kept closer to Chiyo in case it was needed as defence while she operated the other puppets.

- It was shown to have colossal fists and fierce taijutsu skills.
- In the anime it was able to extend its arms to form a sort of cage to trap opponents, where it would then launch four small bombs from its mouth.

- Puppet 5.PNG| Puppet 5 : A bald puppet with large holes in its skull.
