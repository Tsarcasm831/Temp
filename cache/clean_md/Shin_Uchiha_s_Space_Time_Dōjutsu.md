## Summary
Shin Uchiha is able to perform a space–time ninjutsu using his Sharingan. By focusing on nearby targets, the technique can also be used from a distance.

## Notes
- The technique activates quickly enough that it can capture a target before they have time to react, and the size and shape of the spatial barrier can be manipulated to some extent to fit the situation.
- Shin is able to activate this technique using his right eye in order to transport himself to the locations of his spying creatures, emerging from a void created by their own Sharingan.
