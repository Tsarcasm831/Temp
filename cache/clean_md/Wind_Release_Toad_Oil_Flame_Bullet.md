## Summary
This is a three-way synchronised cooperation ninjutsu between Naruto, Gamatatsu, and Gamakichi. It is an expansion of the Wind Release: Toad Oil Bullet technique.

## Notes
- After Naruto enhances Gamatatsu's Toad Oil Bullet with his wind-natured chakra, Gamakichi steps in and uses his Fire Release: Flame Bullet technique to ignite the oil.
- The wind not only improves the oil's coverage and distance, but also adds power to the flame.
- Using this technique they were able to knock out the Three-Tails.
