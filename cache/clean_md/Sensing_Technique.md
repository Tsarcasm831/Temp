## Summary
The Sensing Technique allows sensor type shinobi to mould chakra and change it to the sensor type. This enables them to detect and track down targets through their chakra signatures.

## Counters / Defenses
- * Sensing Hexagram Seal — A hexagram seal that allows the user, by transmitting waves, to sense targets in a large radius, akin to a radar.

## Notes
- The range of this technique varies between sensors.
- With this technique, he is able to send chakra through webs to detect the approach of any enemy, that touches the threads.
- The web is so sensitive, that not even the slightest disturbance of the air goes unnoticed.
- * Mind's Eye of the Kagura — Exclusive to Karin.
- With this technique, she is capable of finding, sensing and tracking any individual over vast range by focusing and opening her mind's eye.
- * Rain Tiger at Will Technique — Exclusive to Nagato.
- Using this, he is capable of creating falling raindrops, which are closely linked to his senses.
- When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected.
- * Sensing Water Sphere — A sphere made out of water that lets the user monitor the surrounding area.
- Despite the usefulness, the sphere itself does not provide a complete form of detection, unless it is complemented with a barrier.
- * Negative Emotions Sensing — Exclusive to Kurama and its jinchūriki.
- Using this technique, the user is capable of detecting negative emotions, such as hatred, of any individual around them.
- * Concealed Sand Picture Cat — Exclusive to Gaara.
- With this technique, he is able to spread specialised sand across a wide terrain and detect anything that comes into contact with it, even if the target is invisible.
- * In the anime, if a sensor struggles sensing beyond a limited range, they can expand it with a medium that employs their chakra to move around.
- Sensing was also methodically compared to the Yamanaka Clan's Mind Body Switch Technique.
