# Summoning: Iron Maiden

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Ibiki Morino
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
Ibiki summons a giant iron maneki neko , which appears beneath the opponent from underground, split down the middle. The statue clamps around the target and is then wrapped in chains, which drag it back down into the ground.

## Drawbacks
- A victim is forced to stand straight up inside until they can no longer support themselves, at which point they are forced to lean forward or backward onto the spines, resulting in a slow and painful death.

## Notes
- The sculpture depicts a cat (traditionally a Japanese Bobtail) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed—many times at the entrance—in shops, restaurants, and other businesses.
- * The iron maiden is a coffin-like torture device with sharp spikes lining the inside.
