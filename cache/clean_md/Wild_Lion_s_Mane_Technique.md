- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Jiraiya, Koji Kashin

## Summary
This technique uses chakra to temporarily enhance the head's metabolism and manipulate the hair that grows longer as a result of it. There is also chakra flowing through the lengthened hair, making its hardness comparable to that of steel wire.

## Drawbacks
- Its name may come from the fact that, as seen just before striking Pain, it takes the shape of what resembles a lion's mouth.

## Notes
- By thickly bundling the hair, its strength is further increased, also increasing its destructive power.
