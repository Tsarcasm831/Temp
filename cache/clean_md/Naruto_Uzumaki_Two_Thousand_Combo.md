# Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu, Clone Techniques, Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Naruto Uzumaki
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Naruto uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, creating a total of one thousand Narutos. Some of the Narutos then kick the target high into the air while yelling "U-ZU-MA-KI", just as is done with the original Naruto Uzumaki Combo.

## Notes
- Once the target is airborne, the one thousand Narutos punch them from every direction with their, combined, two thousand fists, hence the name; the punches are so numerous that targets have no chance to escape.
- Two Narutos then join to deliver a final blow: a simultaneous punch from the left and right.
