# Dead Soul Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Medical Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Kabuto Yakushi
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user performs surgery on a corpse to temporarily make its heart beat again. The user then uses their chakra to both control the body's movements and to hide all signs of the surgery, creating the appearance that the body is a live person.

## Usage
- Kabuto likes to use the corpses he controls as body doubles, altering their faces with plastic surgery so that they look like him; Kabuto himself stays nearby, silencing his heartbeat so that he passes as a corpse.

## Notes
- Kabuto Yakushi takes the extra step of erasing the body's odour so that others won't notice its smell.
- In the anime, reanimated corpses are shown to still possess the same abilities as when they were alive.
