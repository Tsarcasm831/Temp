## Summary
The user creates a dome-shaped sandstorm which surrounds the opponent and prevents them from escaping. During the technique's execution, the used sand particles collide against each other, thus creating electromagnetic waves which place the trapped person under never-ending genjutsu in the form of featureless beings attacking with kunai.

## Notes
- While the target is busy fending these illusions off, they are vulnerable to attacks from the outside.
