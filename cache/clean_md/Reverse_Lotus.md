# Reverse Lotus

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Kinjutsu, Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive
- Range: Short
- Users: Might Guy, Rock Lee
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game, Movie

## Summary
The user first opens at least three of the Eight Gates, removing their body's limitations on their maximum speed. Once this is done, the user - who is so fast that it's difficult to follow their movements - continually strikes the target from multiple directions, pummelling them into the air.

## Counters / Defenses
- When Rock Lee uses Reverse Lotus on Gaara, Gaara's Shield of Sand is unable to react fast enough to protect him.

## Notes
- As Lee attacks Gaara, he gradually wraps Gaara with the bandages he wears, allowing him to better manoeuvre Gaara to deliver a finishing blow that sends him crashing back to the ground.
