## Quick Facts

## Summary
Using his personal sand, Gaara grinds up rocks and minerals underground into a huge volume of sand that he brings above ground. The earth shakes as the sand surfaces, which Gaara then manipulates like a tsunami that he crashes against his targets.

## Notes
- Targets are battered multiple times by the waves of sand as it spreads throughout the area.
- When the sand settles, the landscape is dramatically altered, taking on the appearance of a barren desert.
- Gaara can then use this sand to perform additional attacks, such as Sand Waterfall Imperial Funeral.
