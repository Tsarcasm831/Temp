## Summary
Konan disguises six hundred billion explosive tags as the surrounding scenery, be it earth or water, with enough sophistication that even the Sharingan cannot see through it. This gives the name of this technique the additional meaning Messenger of God â€” a messenger of God being an angel, which is also Konan's moniker.
