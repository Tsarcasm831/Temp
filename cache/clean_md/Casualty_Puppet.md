## Summary
Developed by Orochimaru, this technique allows the user to partially absorb a freshly-killed corpse, transforming it into an extension of the user's body. Though absorbing allows one to gain access to the target's techniques, the use of Casualty Puppet can warp the user's mind and body, making the user highly unstable with only a great shock snapping them back to their senses.
