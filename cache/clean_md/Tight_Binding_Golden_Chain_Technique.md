## Summary
These chains formed by a member of the Uzumaki clan are used offensively rather than the ones used for sealing purposes. Despite these chains having been stated to being an incomplete version of the Adamantine Sealing Chains, Karin was able to use this technique to destroy most of Tobi's giant wooden statue and its many hands.

## Notes
- While said to be incomplete, in the anime, Karin later showed the ability to not only attack with the chains but neutralise her target by binding and nullifying their chakra with the chains.
- When used against Suigetsu Hōzuki, it sent him flying some distance away, leaving him incapacitated and his body in its jelly-like state.
- Karin also seems capable of manipulating the size of her chains to fit the situation.
