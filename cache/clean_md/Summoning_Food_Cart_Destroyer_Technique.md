## Summary
The user summons a toad in the air, which falls to the ground. On impact, the ground shakes, structures are destroyed, and the user's targets are pinned beneath the toad's weight, preventing them from moving.

## Notes
- Jiraiya is skilled enough to, while summoning the toad, add force to the toad's fall, creating the effect that the toad has fallen from several hundred meters higher than it actually did and thus doing greater damage.
