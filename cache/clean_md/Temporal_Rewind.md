# Temporal Rewind

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Kekkei Genkai~Rinnegan, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu
- Class: Defensive, Supplementary
- Users: Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
- Media: Anime

## Summary
In preparation of being struck, the user activates their Rinnegan as glowing blue. This technique allows them to warp several seconds into the past.

## Counters / Defenses
- With the acquired knowledge of how the near-future will happen, a perfect counter-strategy can be formed from being able to accurately tell how the enemy will act.

## Drawbacks
- However, due to the effects of the technique, the user experiences more time than those around them, putting the user at risk of prolonged exposure to hazardous conditions.

## Notes
- While normally defensive, essentially allowing the user to seemingly teleport away from danger, repeated usage of this technique grants a pseudo-form of clairvoyance.
