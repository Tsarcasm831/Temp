## Summary
This is a cooperation Space–Time Ninjutsu taught to the Hokage Guard Platoon by the Fourth Hokage to better aid in their duties of protecting the seated Hokage. In doing so, they encircle the target performing the seal of confrontation so that their thumbs, middle, and index fingers are touching one another's.

## Usage
- This allows them to teleport both themselves, and anything within the confines of the ring, to a marked destination.

## Notes
- Since becoming the guards of the Fifth Hokage, they have marked her with the technique's formula so that they can teleport to her side at any time.
