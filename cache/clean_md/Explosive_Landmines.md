## Summary
After creating the C2 Dragon, Deidara has the clay dragon spawn numerous clay mines and has his partner bury them underground, thus allowing unsuspecting victims to walk on the mines which then explode. These landmines explode automatically when they're stepped on.

## Usage
- As such, they're not under Deidara's control.

## Notes
- * In Naruto ShippÅ«den: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3 , Obito just buries them in front or around the opponent.
- * When Deidara and Obito used this technique, the latter used the Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique to bury them, while a White Zetsu Army clone used his Mayfly technique to bury the mines.
