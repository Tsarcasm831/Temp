# Odour-Concealing Bubbles

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu,
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Burami,
- Media: Anime

## Summary
The user first smells the scent of their allies and produces sweat with movements. After sucking up sweat, it is then mixed with saliva to create a bubble from their mouth that lets them conceal natural body odour of their allies and themselves.

## Notes
- A variation of this technique is done to fool enemies by producing many small bubbles of user's own smell by following same method and scattering it over a wide area.
- Except in this technique the user doesn't take scents of their allies and the bubbles do not conceal the smell.
