## Summary
The Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique , utilised by Mei Terumī through her unique Lava Release, manipulates a strong acidic mud flow, even capable of corroding flesh. Mei changes chakra inside her body into a powerful acidic fluid that will melt anything and spits out the viscous fluid from her mouth.

## Usage
- By distributing the liquid across a vast range, she creates an acid wall.

## Notes
- Both the shape and the amount are determined by her.
- By spitting it out at short-range the technique's speed increases.
- Anything that touches it will crumble and lose its shape.
- Should her initial attack miss, a great deal of smoke is created by the effects of the acid, so a follow-up attack can be conducted while the enemy's vision remains obscured.
- It can even melt chakra-based defences such as the Susanoo.
- * In games, movies and initially in the anime, this technique was depicted to look like lava.
