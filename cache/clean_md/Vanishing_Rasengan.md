## Summary
The Vanishing Rasengan is a Lightning Release version of the Rasengan, that was created by Boruto Uzumaki, and named by Sasuke Uchiha. As it glides, the nature transformation abruptly kicks in, resulting in the technique disappearing from sight.

## Drawbacks
- Momoshiki ÅŒtsutsuki himself later noted that it is too weak to cause a mortal wound, but is quite painful when it strikes a vital point.

## Notes
- This adds an element of surprise to the attack, as an opponent may lower their guard, assuming that the technique has dispersed, only to find themselves struck by the invisible attack.
- The size of Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan has seen a significant increase after the Mujina Bandits Arc, where it was shown to be around the size of a regular Rasengan.
- With enough chakra added to it, the Rasengan can become giant.
- In the anime, Kakashi Hatake notes that the invisible nature comes by a loss in offensive power, rendering this technique as incomplete.
- * In the anime, Naruto was able to throw a standard Rasengan, similar to the main function of this technique.
- * In various media, when Boruto uses this technique, he simply calls it "Rasengan".
- * In Boruto OVA, this technique was depicted as orange in colour, similarly to how the original Rasengan is sometimes depicted being yellow in the manga when used by Naruto, and orange on one Jump cover.
