## Summary
Daikokuten is a technique of the Kokugan. Kawaki’s usage has shown to be able to store living people inside this dimension as well, though unlike inanimate objects, when transporting a person into the dimension he is shown using an inescapable rift similar to another jutsu of his.

## Notes
- Anything stored there will remain in pristine condition and can instantaneously be retrieved at will.
- The objects retrieved are manifested with such speed that they can catch attentive opponents, such as Sharingan-wielding Sasuke Uchiha, and Six Paths Sage Mode-empowered Naruto Uzumaki off guard while inflicting serious bodily harm on them.
- * Daikokuten is the name of one of the Seven Lucky Gods of Buddhism, the great god of darkness/blackness, and is depicted wielding the Uchide no Kozuchi.
- * While inhabiting Jigen's body, this technique normally required hand gestures in order to summon the foreign matter back.
- * When using this technique, Isshiki's right eye's pattern changes, with a pupil appearing within the eight intersecting spokes.
