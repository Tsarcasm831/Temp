## Summary
By flowing concentrated chakra from one's palms into the flowing underground, one can tear the earth apart, creating large chasms. The length, width, direction, and curve of the chasm are shaped and fashioned by the user.

## Usage
- Manipulating the Dragon Veins requires fine chakra control, but if one has such skill, they can use this technique to divide the space between the enemy and their own team in two, destroy enemy camps or defences, and even to attack.

## Notes
- They are energy flows running underground, usually along mountain ranges, and are similar to the Western concept of Ley lines.
- * Dragon Veins are mentioned as an ancient source of chakra in Naruto ShippÅ«den the Movie: The Lost Tower .
