# Mind Body Disturbance Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden~Yamanaka Clan, Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Inoichi Yamanaka, Ino Yamanaka~anime
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user sends their chakra into a target's nervous system, giving them full control over the target's body. Unlike the Mind Body Switch Technique, the user's consciousness remains within their own body while they use this technique, meaning that it can safely be used even when the user is outnumbered.

## Usage
- Because only their bodies are being controlled, targets remain aware of what their body is doing, though they won't understand why.
- Users can control targets even from a distance, allowing the user to sow confusion among the target and their allies.

## Notes
- It is when outnumbered that this technique is most useful, as the user's opponents can be made to kill each other.
- this technique can freely manipulate multiple bodies simultaneously.
- *When this technique was used in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and the later games, Inoichi suddenly appears in front of Ino in order to tell the victim he'll be his opponent.
- He then uses this technique, immobilizing the opponent with the intent to let her daughter attack the victim.
- She then runs to his opponent and punches them into the sky.
- Both high-five afterwards.
