# Water Droplet Reflection Sight

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, D≈çjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Yome
- Media: Anime

## Summary
By dilating her pupils, Yome is able to track down enemies via the reflection on tiny water droplets. According to Sen, once Yome has fixated her sight, her visual range reaches several dozen kilometres.

## Notes
- Yome can also use this ability to augment her evasion-skills during combat.
- Downsides of this technique are the evaporation of water droplets caused by the sun, which complicates the usage of the technique and shortens its period of time and her sensitivity towards blinding light, for example caused by a flash bomb.
