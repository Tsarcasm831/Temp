# Coral Palm

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Taijutsu
- Class: Offensive, Supplementary
- Range: Short
- Users: Yagura Karatachi, Isobu<!-- Do not remove Isobu, the Fourth Databook implied that it is a user -->
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
While in his transformed state, Yagura strikes the opponent with a powerful blow, causing a large formation of coral to quickly grow from the initial point of contact. This then rapidly solidifies and restricts the enemy's mobility, as the substance continues to grow, eventually covering their entire body.

## Notes
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 and later games, Yagura, without going into his transformed state, is capable of slamming his hand on the ground to create coral, perhaps due to his status as a perfect jinchūriki.
