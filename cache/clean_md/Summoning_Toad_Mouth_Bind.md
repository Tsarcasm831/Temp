## Summary
Unlike the usual practice of summoning an entire creature, the user instead summons only the oesophagus of a giant toad from . The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice.

## Notes
- The walls of the oesophagus are sticky and pliable, making it difficult for opponents to keep their footing and, therefore, fight as normal.
- The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.
- In the anime, Jiraiya demonstrates the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique.
- This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic poison that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect.
- Though it can be endured in small amounts, this poison begins to paralyse a person's entire body after ten minutes of continuous exposure, indiscriminately affecting anyone contained within the stomach.
- Naruto's own wallet is a reference to this word as well.
- * In various video games, parts of the oesophagus also spew fire.
