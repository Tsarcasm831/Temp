## Summary
Blood Dragon Ascension is a technique that involves the ability of manipulating blood, exclusive of the members of the Chinoike Clan. Through this ability, the user forms a dragon of blood with eight heads similar to the "Yamata no Orochi", which all have the ability to regenerate.

## Counters / Defenses
- * Unlike its novel counterpart, the blood dragon in the anime didn't seem to possess the ability to regenerate its heads.

## Notes
- In addition to the regeneration, the heads of the dragon also have the capacity to release steam after biting a target.
- The dragon formed is strong enough to restrict the movements of Sasuke Uchiha's Susanoo and was able to withstand his Lightning Release, when Chino used it in conjunction with the iron-rich hot-springs of the Valley of Hell, in the Land of Hot Water.
