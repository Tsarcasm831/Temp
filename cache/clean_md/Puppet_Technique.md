## Summary
The Puppet Technique is the core skill of a fighting style, whereby they control a puppet. Monzaemon originally intended the Puppet Technique for purely entertainment purposes, but by collaborating with shinobi he adapted the skill for combat.

## Usage
- Performing the Puppet Technique involves emitting from a user's fingers to connect to a puppet, with the fingers' movements controlling the puppet's actions.
- Controlling a puppet requires most of a puppeteer's attentions and maintaining the threads is a constant drain on their chakra.
- The threads can also be used to wrap around opponents in order to restrict their movements.
- The threads can be connected to opponents to impede their movements, such as by tripping them, or to take control of their body, using them as a puppet.
- The Ōtsutsuki were able to control their puppets (or other people) remotely from seemingly any distance.
- The novelization of The Last: Naruto the Movie explains that this was achieved by placing orbs of chakra within the puppets' bodies, allowing the Ōtsutsuki to control their puppets through thought alone.
- Over time, these puppets became mostly autonomous, requiring no conscious effort to control and only needing the Tenseigan to power their movements.
- In Gaara Hiden , after Kankurō studies reports of the Ōtsutsuki's puppets, he achieves a similar effect by using imperceptibly thin chakra threads; although this doesn't make his puppets autonomous, it does significantly increase the range he can control them from.
- * In some Naruto video games, Kankurō demonstrates greater versatility in hand-to-hand combat than puppeteers are said to possesses, as he mixes his puppet control with haymakers and other forms of taijutsu.

## Counters / Defenses
- In the event that an opponent gets too close, some puppeteers have devised countermeasures: certain puppets created by Sasori, such as Sanshōuo and Hiruko, are intended to be controlled from the inside, acting as shields for their puppeteers; Chiyo replaced one of her arms with a Mechanical Light Shield Block, giving her a defensive option to use in emergencies; Kankurō is in the habit of disguising puppets as himself, causing opponents that attack him to instead fall into his puppets' clutches.

## Drawbacks
- Centuries before Monzaemon created his version of the Puppet Technique, the Ōtsutsuki clan used a different version that had fewer of the above drawbacks.

## Notes
- In the years following the technique's creation, Suna's shinobi became pioneers in the art of puppetry, with its Puppet Brigade being given the specific mandate of finding new ways to use and exploit puppets for battle.
- No matter how many threads are being used per puppet, the user's will plays a large role in a puppet's movements, thus creating an inevitable time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response.
- It should also be noted that, while the Chakra Threads are difficult to notice, it is possible to cut them, effectively disabling the puppet in the process.
- Because puppeteers rely on their puppets for almost all aspects of combat, keeping the puppets safe is of paramount importance.
- At the simplest, this means not allowing the puppets to be destroyed or otherwise disabled.
- More than that, it is also vital to keep how a puppet works secret from opponents.
- If an opponent knows what weapons or traps a puppet is outfitted with, the puppeteer will lose the advantage of surprise that so often gives them the upperhand.
- If an opponent knows how a puppet is designed – which, unlike weapons and traps, cannot be greatly altered by the puppeteer – they can focus their attacks on the puppet's structural weaknesses.
- If a puppeteer does lose their puppet in battle (or if they merely opt not to use one), the chakra threads remain a versatile tool.
- Puppeteers can attach chakra threads to faraway targets even without this subterfuge, giving them a quick way to bring objects to their side.
- * - practised by Sasori and Kankurō.
- * - practised by Kankurō and Shinki.
- He achieved this by connecting his chakra threads to pipes that distributed chakra across Rōran, expanding the number of threads and distance he could cover.
