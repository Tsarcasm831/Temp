## Summary
A seal placed on the Fire Temple's gate to protect against intruders from the outside world. The two statues placed on either side of the gate form a barrier.

- However, a powerful enough physical strike can break through the defences, as demonstrated with Kakuzu's Earth Release: Earth Spear.
