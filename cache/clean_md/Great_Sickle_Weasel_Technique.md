# Great Sickle Weasel Technique

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Wind Release
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Offensive, Defensive
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Temari
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
Using her Giant Folding Fan, Temari causes many currents of wind to collide with each other, creating vacuum pockets. As the wind moves outward from her, it cuts up whatever it comes into contact with and deflects any attacks coming towards her, even sound-based genjutsu.

## Notes
- Because of how far the winds travel, this technique is especially useful against opponents that attack from long ranges.
- Temari's summon, Kamatari, is a sickle weasel.
