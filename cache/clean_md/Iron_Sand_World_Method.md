## Summary
This technique uses Iron Sand to create a gigantic sphere of branching spikes. The user first creates two masses of Iron Sand of opposing magnetic fields and then merges them together.

## Notes
- This causes the magnetic forces to instantly increase and the repellent force created by the two opposing magnetic fields scatters the Iron Sand across a vast area.
- The Iron Sand spreads in spikes that branch off irregularly, making it almost impossible to get a clear overview of what is happening.
- This also makes evading the spikes nearly impossible.
- Even if the opponent has managed to evade getting hit, the Iron Sand spikes will have filled the entire surroundings, cutting off any escape routes.
- With the opponent trapped, the user is free to attack in person.
- Because Sasori coats his Iron Sand in his lethal poison, the technique is even deadlier; if one of the spikes so much as scratches the target, it will introduce enough poison into the target's body to kill them.
