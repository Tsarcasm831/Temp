## Summary
The user kneads chakra in their body and turns it into fire, which they then expel from their mouth; the more chakra they use, the more flames that are produced. Sometimes the flames lack a distinct shape, being only a stream, but more often than not they take the form of a giant orb that maintains its shape until hitting a target.

## Counters / Defenses
- * Several different hand seals have been given for this technique during the course of the series:
** Rin no Sho lists the hand seals as Horse and Tiger.
- ** In Naruto: Shippūden episode 4, Kakashi uses an unknown amount of hand seals in quick succession, using many more than the usual six.

## Notes
- Upon impact, the fireball is powerful enough to crater the ground and vaporise the surroundings.
- The Uchiha in fact used the Great Fireball Technique as a coming of age rite, with members not being considered true adults until they learned to perform it.
- In keeping with this, the manga has only ever shown Uchiha using this technique; the anime at times depicts non-Uchiha performing it.
- ** In Naruto: Shippūden episode 15, Itachi uses Boar, Horse, and Tiger.
