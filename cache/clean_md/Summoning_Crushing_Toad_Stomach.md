# Summoning: Crushing Toad Stomach

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Spaceâ€“Time Ninjutsu,
- Class: Offensive
- Users: Jiraiya
- Media: Anime

## Summary
This technique bares some similarity to the Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind technique. However, instead of warping the battlefield into the digestive tracts of a giant toad, Jiraiya reverse summons himself and his opponents into the stomach of a giant toad (possibly the same species as the giant, fire-breathing toad used in his Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind technique), essentially bringing the battle to a new battlefield.

## Usage
- This technique is also similar to the Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison, which is used to capture and isolate a victim, trapping them inside of a toads stomach, cutting them off from any allies, but also completely immobilising them while the stomach crushes the opponents to death.
