## Summary
This technique is a larger-scale version of the standard Shadow Clone Technique; there is no real difference between them beyond the number of shadow clones being created. Creating even a single shadow clone will require half of a user's chakra, for which reason the normal Shadow Clone Technique is generally only safe to use for jōnin.

## Counters / Defenses
- For this reason, the First Hokage declared it forbidden and hid it away in the Scroll of Seals.
- * In Kakashi Hiden , while waiting for his new arm, Naruto creates shadow clones with a one-handed seal: a cross with his left hand's index and middle finger.

## Drawbacks
- Because of how many clones are created with the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the chakra cost is far greater, rendering it unsafe to use for most people other than the Hokage.

## Notes
- Naruto Uzumaki is among the few exceptions to this rule because of the sheer amount of chakra he has access to.
- Naruto also utilises the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while creating the Wind Release: Rasengan, completing years' worth of training within a matter of days.
- Despite this, he performs a Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, creating dozens of copies of himself and scaring the thugs away.
- * In the anime, when Hōki claims to be using the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, he is actually using the Haze Clone Technique.
- * In the anime, Boruto Uzumaki pretends to use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique by having his classmates transform into him.
- ** He later uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique through the Shinobi Gauntlet, and then by himself against Deepa.
