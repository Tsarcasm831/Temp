## Summary
While occupying Sakon's body, Ukon adds his feet to Sakon's kicks; when Sakon is about to kick something, both of Ukon's legs sprout from Sakon's leg. Ukon's kicks can be performed simultaneously with Sakon's, increasing their combined power to the point of sending targets flying, or they can be performed in intervals, spacing out the damage to their target.
