## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden~Fūma Clan (Land of Sound), Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu
- Users: Arashi
- Media: Anime, Game

## Summary
After performing various hand seals, the user is able to perform an ancient ninja art that is only known to a few generations of the Fūma clan. The technique traps the victim in a pyramid-like chakra cage which will slowly constrict as the user moves his hands closer together.

## Counters / Defenses
- The user of this technique must maintain a triangle-shaped hand seal at all times to maintain the cage.

## Notes
- Anyone caught in the Mandala as it constricts will be crushed.
- Should the user's will falter or the entrapped opponent happen to be strong enough, the cage can be broken.
- When the cage breaks, a massive explosion of energy follows, destroying a wide area and harming the user.
- The prisoner however, remains safe at the centre of the blast.
- However, while this technique is decreased in size to compress the target's container, the Dust Release techniques are usually increased in size to increase the range of the attack.
