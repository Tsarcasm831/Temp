# Pressure Points of Harm and Death

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu,
- Class: Supplementary
- Users: Guren
- Media: Anime

## Summary
Guren releases two tenketsu points to greatly increase her chakra and physical capabilities for a short time by changing her life force into chakra. This allows the use of taxing techniques such as Crystal Release: String of Glory.

## Notes
- The amount of chakra released is so much that it becomes visible and causes water to form a vortex around her, similar to the one caused by opening the "Sixth Gate of Joy" from the Eight Gates.
- Her eyes also turn completely white momentarily.
