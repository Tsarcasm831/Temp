## Summary
The Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands is a technique which creates a titanic, many-handed wooden statue that can be freely controlled by the user. Thousands of hands originate from the statue's back in countless concentric rows, while its two main hands are clasped, as if in prayer.

## Usage
- Hashirama can then use the Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands in conjunction with the Wood Human on the statue's head to suppress and remove any direct control over the tailed beast.

## Notes
- The statue can serve a variety of purposes in battle, from fighting on the user's behalf to defending and even using other techniques.
- The sheer size of this technique makes it almost impossible to attack the user.
- It can also detach its main self from its main arsenal to increase its mobility to adapt to a situation that requires more speed.
- With its immense strength, it can grab hold of a tailed beast with ease and hold it in place, leaving it unable to move.
- One prominent story tells of Kannon vowing never to rest until he had freed all beings from Saṃsāra.
- After strenuous effort, but struggling to comprehend the needs of so many who still had yet to be saved, his head splits into eleven pieces.
- The Buddha Amida, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering.
- Upon hearing and comprehending these cries, Kannon attempted to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces.
- Once more, Amida comes to his aid and grants him a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering.
- * In Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections , Asura's usage of the jutsu has the statue firing a large Amenomihashira at the opponent.
