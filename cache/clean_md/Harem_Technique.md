## Notes
- Killer B is unmoved by it.
- ** Naruto video games take the additional step of having all the shadow clones wearing swimsuits.
- * In Naruto episode 193, Naruto instead has his shadow clones transform into (fully clothed) Sakura Harunos, taking advantage of Rock Lee's feelings for her.
- * In Naruto chapter 492, Naruto's fringes when using this jutsu are styled different than the usual.
- This style was never used again, nor was it adapted into the anime in Naruto: ShippÅ«den episode 243.
