## Summary
A technique that's available to Naruto after inheriting the Sage of the Six Paths' powers. By combining his Rasengan with Shukaku's Magnet Release to reinforce its suction power, he creates a Rasengan with the beast's cursed seal markings.

## Notes
- He then smashes the sphere into his opponent in the same manner as a normal Rasengan.
- Upon being struck with this technique, the markings quickly spread across the target's body and immobilises them.
- In the anime, it was depicted as being made of chakra, while in the manga, the Rasengan is solid.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Naruto refers to this technique just as the "Rasengan", rather than the full name.
