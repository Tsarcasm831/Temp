## Summary
The Spear of Shukaku is the attack counterpart of the Shield of Shukaku. Like the shield, Gaara crushes the hardest materials from the ground using sand, this time in the form of a halberd, in the shape of the Shukaku's hand.

## Counters / Defenses
- Just like the shield which has yet to find anything that could break its defence, the halberd has yet to find a defence that it can't break through.
