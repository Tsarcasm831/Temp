## Summary
A more powerful variation of Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm. The user hits the target at close range with a powerful wave of chakra emitted from their palm, which sends them flying back, causing severe damage.

## Notes
- * In Naruto Shipp큰den: Ultimate Ninja 4 and Naruto Shipp큰den: Ultimate Ninja 5 when the technique is used, Neji spins toward his opponent and places both his hands on the opponent's body with his left hand sideways above his right hand which is pointing down.
- After calling out the attack a massive beam of chakra shoots through them and carves through the rocky terrain behind them, making it visually different from the version used in the anime.
