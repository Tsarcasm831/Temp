## Summary
is a hiden utilised by the Akimichi clan and forms the basis of all their clan techniques. Akimichi who are less experienced with this technique make use of the Three Coloured Pills to initiate this process, however, these pills have the adverse effect of converting all the calories in the user's body to chakra.

## Notes
- Once perfected, however, the Akimichi no longer has need for the pills and can regulate how much of their body weight is converted at any given time.
- Members of the clan are usually described as being gluttonous as a result.
