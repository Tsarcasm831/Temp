## Summary
The Curse Technique: Death Controlling Possessed Blood is the exclusive jujutsu technique of Hidan and his primary method of killing his opponents under Jashinism. The other being him to acquire and ingest the blood of his intended victim.

## Drawbacks
- However, he does indeed complain that it hurts like one normally does in pain, after he finished off Asuma.

## Notes
- Once ingested, his skin then turns black with white markings which makes him look like a skeleton, a symbol of absolute death.
- This serves as the link between him and his victim.
- Once his sacrificial ritual takes place, the victim's body is linked with Hidan's curse until he either steps or is forced out of the circle.
- Any kind of injury that Hidan inflicts upon himself (or the injury they inflicted on him) is reciprocated on his target, be it a mere scratch to a pierce in the heart.
- If Hidan is forced to step out of the circle, the link is temporarily broken and the victim is set free, but only as long as Hidan has stepped out of the circle's reach.
- Basically, this technique makes Hidan a living voodoo doll.
