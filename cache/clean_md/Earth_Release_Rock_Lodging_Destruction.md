## Summary
This technique destroys the equilibrium that allows a cave to remain standing. By removing the supporting spot, such as a single rock, even the most solid cave becomes fragile and ultimately collapses.

## Notes
- A favourite tactic of Iwagakure-nin is to lure opponents into a cave and to then perform this technique.
- Stones gradually fall upon the opponents until finally a cave-in is caused, wiping them out.
