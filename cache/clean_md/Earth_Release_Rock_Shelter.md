## Summary
The user surrounds themselves with earth, taken from the immediate vicinity and creates a formation of rock that is capable of protecting both the user and others in close proximity, if desired. Doing so, seemingly leaves the surrounding terrain unaltered, even when the quantity of earth used is enough to form a complete dome around multiple individuals as seen when Ittan used this technique.

## Notes
- The user can also manipulate the resulting shelter to have openings in it to be able to observe outside, as demonstrated when used by Kitsuchi.
