## Summary
The Shadow Imitation Shadow Bind Technique is one of the hijutsu utilised by members of the Nara clan. The Nara attaches their shadow to a "host's" own without restricting their movements, or forcing them to mimic their own movement.

## Usage
- This allows the host to move freely all the while the Nara's shadow is still attached to their own.
- This technique allows for the Nara to bind multiple targets on a battlefield all while not directly engaging in combat, adding an element of surprise to their companion's attacks.

## Notes
- Through the shadow, the Nara is able to sense when their combined shadow comes into contact with the target's, basically using the latter's own shadow as an intermediary to link up other shadows in proximity, and they can then bind them with the Shadow Imitation Technique.
