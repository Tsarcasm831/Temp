# Summoning: Rashōmon

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu
- Class: Defensive
- Users: Hashirama Senju, Orochimaru, Sakon and Ukon
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
The user summons a large gate; Sakon and Ukon can only summon it together. The gate itself is designed to look frightening, with the gate's doors having a demonic face upon them; this is to intimidate onlookers, potentially warding them off.

## Counters / Defenses
- The gate's doors are tightly shut and solidly built, making it useful as a shield against most forms of physical attack.

## Notes
- The stronger the attack, the more damage the attacker will do to themselves when they try and fail to break through the gate.
- Despite this, Orochimaru can also use a three gate variant, and beyond that is a five gate variant.
- In the anime, this gate possesses offensive capabilities, with launchers installed in the roof-tiles that fire swarms of blades via a chain mechanism.
- However, launching too many of them near its base will cripple its foundation and the gate will collapse.
- * In some Naruto video games, this technique is used offensively, the gate being summoned directly beneath the target.
- Some games depict the gate opening and dropping the target in another dimension.
