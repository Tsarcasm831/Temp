## Influences

Buddhists believe that animals inhabit a different dimension separated from humans not spatially but mentally, called the "Tiryagyoni realm"; an unhappy plane of rebirth which revolves around fear, instinct and survival of the fittest, suffered by those animals that work for humans and, above all, by those ignorant to what is happening to them.

## Notes
- The Animal Path can also summon people using hand signs, such as the case of Nagato's Paths and Konan.
- Tactics-wise, the Animal Path's primary role in battle appears to consist of overwhelming multiple opponents with a barrage of summons.
- Nagato also tends to send the Animal Path first into battle to throw enemies off about the number of enemies they are really facing.
- As they also display the Rinnegan, the creatures serve as extensions of Nagato.
- During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used his summons for transport before being rejuvenated to move on his own power.
