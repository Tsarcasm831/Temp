## Summary
An Aburame has thousands of their kikaichū gather together until they've taken on the size and appearance of the Aburame, to be used either as a decoy or a diversion. The insect clone can be created anywhere that the kikaichū are positioned or sent to, making it more useful for certain tasks than a shadow clone.

## Notes
- In the anime, the insect clones take a solid enough form to coordinate with the user for joint attacks.
