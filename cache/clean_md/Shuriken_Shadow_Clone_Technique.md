## Summary
This technique was invented by Hiruzen Sarutobi, demonstrating his title as the "Professor" with its conceptualisation and efficiency. After throwing a single shuriken, the user duplicates it with their chakra, in the same way that the Shadow Clone Technique makes copies of the user; creating shadow clones is already difficult on its own, but specifically duplicating inanimate objects is even more difficult.

## Counters / Defenses
- Because the shuriken are physically real, the target is attacked from every direction, which they have almost no chance of completely avoiding.
- * In the anime, Naruto Uzumaki uses the Shadow Clone Technique's hand seal to perform the technique.

## Notes
- In an instant, the thousand copied shuriken spread throughout the area, surrounding the target.
- * In the anime, a young Jiraiya attempted to perform this technique.
- Calling it the "Shuriken Whatever Technique", he simply threw a bunch of shuriken after the first one.
- * In Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower , Minato uses this technique to duplicate his Flying Thunder God Kunai.
