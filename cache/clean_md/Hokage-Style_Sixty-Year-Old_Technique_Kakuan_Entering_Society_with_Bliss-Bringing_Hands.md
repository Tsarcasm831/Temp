## Summary
The Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands technique utilises the power of the Wood Release to forcibly suppress a tailed beast's chakra. The user produces the kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its jinchūriki with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.

## Usage
- When Hashirama used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinchūriki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the tailed beast control through his Wood Release: Wood Human Technique, which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast controlled by the Sharingan.
