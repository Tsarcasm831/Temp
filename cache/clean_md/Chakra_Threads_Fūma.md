## Quick Facts
- Classification: Hiden~Fūma Clan (Land of Sound), Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu

- Range: Short, Mid
- Users: Kagerō

## Summary
This is a murder-suicide technique. The user creates threads of chakra that are used to connect the user's heart to another person's.

## Notes
- As long as the two are connected, any internal damage done to one will also be done to the other.
- This ultimately means that, if one person dies, so will the other.
- Only a kunai wrapped in a special Fūma clan tag can safely cut the threads and separate the two.
