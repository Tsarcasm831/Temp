## Summary
The Lightning Release: Double Lariat is a stronger version of the Lightning Release: Lariat, whereby two users perform the technique from both behind and in front of the opponent, creating a scissor effect, up to close to light-speed. When successfully done, the force of the technique will decapitate the target and send their head flying several metres into the air.

## Notes
- Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as Zetsugyū Rairi Nettō .
- * This technique is used as a test to see who will be worthy to become the Raikage's tag-team partner, as the potential candidate must be able to synchronise their strength with the Raikage.
- As such, this technique is feared even outside of Kumogakure.
- * This move might be a reference to the move from the Kinnikuman manga series called Cross Bomber usually performed by Neptuneman and Big The Budo.
