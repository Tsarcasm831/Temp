## Summary
This is a secret taijutsu of the Hyūga clan's main house, traditionally only known by the head of the clan and the clan's heir. Neji Hyūga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius.

## Usage
- * In the anime, if the user does not have focus and precise chakra control when the Revolving Heaven is executed, the user will repel themselves out of the technique.

## Counters / Defenses
- They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin.
- But in this regard it is quite effective, leading Tenten to describe it as an absolute defence superior to the Shield of Sand.
- The only effective means of countering the Revolving Heaven is to prevent the Hyūga from spinning; the anime sometimes depicts it being used without spinning.

## Notes
- The moment before the Hyūga is struck by an attack, they emit chakra from all of their body's tenketsu to block it.
- The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled.
- The user is capable of defending not only themselves but multiple people.
- Revolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hyūga's Byakugan.
- When written as , it means "revolving" or "spinning".
- * In the anime, Revolving Heaven is shown to reach speeds of at least about 1200 km/h (745.6 mph).
- If an opponent can exceed this speed in the direction of the rotation, they can breach the defence.
- * In the anime, the Genjutsu World's Hinata Hyūga can use this technique.
