## Summary
This is a sound-based genjutsu sung by toads, their most powerful genjutsu. Once the toads have harmonized and have begun singing, all opponents – regardless of number or skill – who hear it will fall under the genjutsu's influence.

## Counters / Defenses
- Within the illusion, the victim's mind and movements are sealed within a barrier of water by four toad samurai.

## Notes
- Meanwhile, the users and their victims can still interact and communicate.
- The genjutsu can only be undone when the user gives the order or by having Mount Myōboku's secret Stone Swords driven into the victim's heart.
