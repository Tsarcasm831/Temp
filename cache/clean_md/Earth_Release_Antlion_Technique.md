## Summary
This technique causes the ground and everything on and around it to be sucked in towards the middle of a large pit, much like the method an antlion uses to catch prey. Upon being dragged to the centre, the victim will then be sucked underground.

## Notes
- There the victim, depending on how deep the user makes them sink, will be trapped and/or suffocated.
- The range of the pit is determined by how much chakra is put into the technique.
- The antlion theme fits in with Kagerō's appearance, emphasising her large jaw in this form.
