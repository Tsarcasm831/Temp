# Summoning: Quintuple Rashōmon

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu
- Class: Defensive
- Users: Hashirama Senju
- Media: Anime, Manga

## Summary
While one is already boasted as an absolute defense, the user — without the need of hand seals — instantly summons five Rashōmon gates to neutralise incoming attacks. The user can alter the positioning of all five gates, even if it is to change the trajectory of an attack.

## Notes
- Not only were the combination of these gates able to redirect an attack as powerful as a Tailed Beast Ball equipped with a Susanoo sword, but they remained standing upon impact.
