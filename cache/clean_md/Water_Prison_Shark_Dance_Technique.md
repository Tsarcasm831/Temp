# Water Prison Shark Dance Technique

## Quick Facts
- Element/Type: Water Release,
- Classification: Ninjutsu
- Class: Supplementary
- Range: Short, Mid, Long
- Users: Kisame Hoshigaki
- Media: Anime, Manga, Game

## Summary
After using the Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave, Kisame forms the water into a gigantic prison. Because he acts as the centre of the dome of water, the dome alters its position in order to reflect the direction of his movements, making it difficult for his target to escape as long as he continues his pursuit.

## Notes
- Fusing with Samehada provides Kisame a tremendous advantage.
- This fused form grants him the ability to breathe underwater while his target continues to drown as they attempt to futilely escape the large body of water.
- This technique is extremely effective in one on one fights, but the user would probably not be able to contain two enemies fleeing in opposite directions.
