## Summary
The Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags is a technique which forms part of a fighting style purposely designed for those who have been reincarnated, and employs the use of special explosive tags to create a near infinite series of explosions. By using their own body as a medium for the paper, the reincarnated individual creates several exploding tags formed from large sheets that each bear five seals on them.

## Notes
- These special tags then attach themselves to the intended target, but just as they detonate, additional tags are created as these previous ones explode.
- This process is continuously repeated, leading to a near infinite chain reaction of consecutive explosions.
- By sacrificing themselves, this technique can also be employed by a live individual.
- ** As 五情, it refers to the five passions (anger, joy, hatred, desire, and grief).
- ** As 互譲, it means "conciliation" or "compromise".
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , Tobirama uses this technique in conjunction with the Water Release, trapping the opponent in the massive Water Prison Technique and then destroying it with the explosion of the explosive tags.
