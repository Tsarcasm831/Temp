## Summary
Black Receivers are black rods that function as demodulators for high-frequency chakra signals. Users are able to create and transmit their chakra into these receivers for a variety of purposes.

## Usage
- On one occasion, these rods pierced Nagato's back and drained him of his life force, which allowed him to control the statue.
- * Black rods have sprouted from Obito's artificial right half on several occasions: upon first awakening his Mangekyō Sharingan and using Wood Release, when Madara used the rods to control his actions, and when Black Zetsu first coated his body and forced him to revive Madara.
- * When Obito was the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, he converted one of his Truth-Seeking Balls into six black receivers, which he used to activate the Six Red Yang Formation.
- As they are controlled by the user's chakra, opponents can prevent these bodies from moving by removing all of their receivers.
- The creatures Nagato summoned through the Animal Path were also embedded with numerous receivers, suggesting he controlled them in a similar manner.

## Counters / Defenses
- The receivers implanted in Obito's Six Paths of Pain doubled as a means of temporarily binding the chakra of the tailed beasts sealed inside the Demonic Statue to their bodies, making them into jinchūriki.
- His absorb chakra instead of transmitting his own to disrupt the chakra of those it pierces.

## Drawbacks
- Offensively employing receivers from afar carries a risk, as those with sensing capabilities can trace the transmitted chakra back to the user when pierced with one.
- The user can fully immobilise the target by stabbing them with multiple rods, Aside from being stabbed, simply touching the receivers can apparently also incur negative effects,

Chakra receivers are also used to control the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that possess copies of the Rinnegan, granting them a shared field of vision with their creator.
- Nagato controlled his Six Paths of Pain using numerous receivers fashioned into piercings, which were implanted all about their bodies, whereas Obito had a single rod implanted in each body's chest.
- * In Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble , Pain's Black Needle Stab temporarily reverses the controls of those stabbed by his black rods.

## Notes
- However, there have been several instances in which black rods were produced through other means:
* While connected to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara Uchiha produced a black rod from Hashirama's artificial body and identified it as a physical manifestation of his will.
- He then told Obito Uchiha to use it when performing the Six Paths Technique.
- They are durable enough to break steel scalpels, as well as sharp enough to pierce through human bodies with ease.
- Though durable, the rods can still be destroyed when struck with sufficient force, and their creator is able to break them apart without any apparent difficulty.
- Once formed, the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation.
- Though chakra being sent to these receivers can be sensed, a skilled user can prevent their location from being discovered by constantly changing the frequency of their chakra.
- When receiving chakra, the black rods noticeably heat up.
- Among other Rinnegan abilities, the bodies are capable of producing additional rods to serve as weapons.
- When they entered Tailed Beast Mode, the receivers would relocate from the jinchūriki's chests up to the tailed beasts' necks.
- When employed offensively, the black rods make for effective weapons.
- They can emerge from the user's hand to stab opponents, be broken off and wielded like swords, or be launched as high-speed projectiles, and the size and shape of the generated receivers can be adjusted to fit the situation.
- He can also manifest chakra chains to bind those touching the receivers with an even greater binding power.
- In the anime, the user can also apply shape transformation to the rods after launching them, altering them into more elaborate forms.
- Black receivers disintegrate when their creator is killed or similarly incapacitated, alongside any Truth-Seeking Balls they may possess.
- though they do eventually heal.
- * Isshiki Ōtsutsuki has employed similar tools; however, they're different in that Isshiki has no Rinnegan, and they function differently.
