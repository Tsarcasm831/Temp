## Summary
Tayuya plays a melody - her "finale" - with the Demonic Flute, causing many-mouthed, worm-like spirits made of chakra to emerge from the mouths of the Doki. The chakra of the spirits is almost entirely spiritual energy, causing them to ravenously seek out physical energy in order to achieve balance.

## Notes
- Tayuya's melody directs the spirits at her targets, who they pursue in so complicated a pattern as to resemble dancing.
- When the spirits pass through the targets, they take bites of physical energy.
- Shikamaru also suggests it uses the same "special chakra" as his clan's Yin techniques.
- * The full name of this technique is .
- * Shikamaru Nara believes this technique is hiden because of the special chakra it uses.
