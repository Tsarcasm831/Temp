## Summary
After using the Pressure Points of Harm and Death technique, Guren encases herself in a prism of transparent blue crystal. The prism can hover in the air, but seems to be immobile.

## Usage
- In addition, this technique allows her to attack by focusing her chakra into powerful heat blasts launched through the prism's tip.

## Notes
- However, the prism protects her from almost any attack, as it was capable of withstanding a barrage of continuous Rasengan, only shattering in the end.
