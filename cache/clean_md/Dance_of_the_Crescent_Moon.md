## Summary
The user and two of their shadow clones attack a target from different directions with a bladed weapon. As they move towards their target, the attackers usually leap through the air in a formation reminiscent of the crescent moon, hence the name.

## Notes
- Because all three attacks are meant to simultaneously come from a blindspot, targets can't reasonably defend against all of them.
- Moreover, because of the power behind the strikes, if even one of them lands successfully, the target is likely to be fatally wounded.
- * "Mikazuki" is the name of one of the Tenka-Goken, five Japanese swords that are of historical and cultural significance.
- * In the original anime, they were simply afterimages with no form to hide an attack coming from above; however, this was changed in Shippūden when the fight was revisited.
