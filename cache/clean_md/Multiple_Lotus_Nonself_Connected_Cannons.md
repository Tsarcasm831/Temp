## Summary
While in the second state of their Sage Transformation, the user grows more of their jet booster-like appendages, extends them, and then uses them to gather natural energy before releasing it as a powerful chakra blast, covering a wide range. The rate at which the chakra is gathered and released is so fast that escaping the technique is impossible through normal means.

## Notes
- In Jūgo's case, his second personality is detached from his normal self.
- The looks of this technique and the second part of its name make an allusion to acorn barnacles, called in Japanese.
- The kanji 不自 literally mean "negative self", once again referring to Jūgo's second personality.
