## Summary
Tayuya plays her Demonic Flute in order to control the three Doki. The tune she plays determines their overall behaviour, as well as how each individual Doki moves, attacks, and works with each other.

## Usage
- In order to prevent opponents from analysing which tune produces which action, Tayuya embeds the tunes within a complicated melody; to be able to do this requires a good ear for music and skill with a flute.
