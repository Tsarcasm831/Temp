# Clone Technique

## Quick Facts
- Classification: Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques, General skill
- Class: Supplementary
- Media: Anime, Manga, Novel, Game

## Summary
This is a basic technique that every shinobi can use. In fact, Konohagakure's Ninja Academy prevents students from graduating unless they master this technique, and it was for this reason that Naruto Uzumaki failed three exams in a row.

## Notes
- For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves.
- Unlike most other clone techniques, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents.
- Because of this, it is only useful for distracting enemies while other attacks are prepared.
