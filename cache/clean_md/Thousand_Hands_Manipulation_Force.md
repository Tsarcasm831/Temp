## Summary
The Thousand Hands Manipulation Force is a technique which is used through the puppet of the Third Kazekage. These compartments are prepared with summoning seals in them, which call forth a large number of long puppet arms that can bend and follow the opponent, then crush them with devastating force.

## Notes
- The arms are modified with launchers, which can emit poison gas, binding wires with a kunai-anchor, or regular kunai.
- Sasori can detach the entire left arm (with the thousand arms) to regain mobility for the puppet, and a buzzsaw takes its place.
