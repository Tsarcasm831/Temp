- Users: YÅ«ga

## Summary
The user sacrifices their life to summon an otherworldly spectre. As they begin the hand seals, green seals spread across their body, and the user prays to the spectre.

## Counters / Defenses
- The golem is highly resilient, able to resist chakra-enhanced strikes, and much faster than its size would imply, able to cover distances very quickly.

## Notes
- The jutsu turns the user into a red gemstone that then fuses with the spectre, turning it into a golem and creating an enormous barrier around its targets.
- It generally drains chakra indiscriminately from whatever living creature it can reach inside the barrier, which it can use to regenerate any damaged anatomy.
- If it detects damage to the barrier, it will ignore closer targets to prevent further damage.
- Its weak spot is the red gemstone, destroying it will both defeat the golem and break the barrier.
