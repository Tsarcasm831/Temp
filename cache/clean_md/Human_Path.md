## Summary
The grants a Rinnegan user the ability to read the mind of any target by placing their hand on the target's head or chest, thus obtaining even the most well-guarded secrets. This process kills the target, with their souls being physically removed from their body once users pull their hand away.

- It is widely believed that the Human realm is the form of rebirth most likely to attain enlightenment, due to both the availability of information and teachers, and the ability to reason without falling victim to the obsessive aggression or carnal delights inherited by the higher planes.
- * Although the use of this technique usually resulted in the victim's death, the person's soul could also be stored within the King of Hell.
