## Summary
Gaara, while preparing to enter Tailed Beast Mode, shapes the sand coating his arms into multiple shuriken. By swinging his arms - which are more powerful than normal because of his transformation - the shuriken are launched rapidly, with additional volleys being possible with each additional swing.

## Notes
- The Sand Shuriken, made to be stronger than steel, easily cut through whatever they come into contact with.
- This technique is a useful way to fend off approaching attackers, as well as a good way to stop opponents from fleeing.
