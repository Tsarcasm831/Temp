Because the attack does hit ''something'', opponents may briefly believe that they've successfully struck the user. But this is merely an optical illusion and opponents will quickly notice what's happened. If users are fast enough, they can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack;<ref name=\"d1\"/> in the anime, the replacement log itself has been shown used as an attack, being applied with [[explosive tag]]s.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 72</ref> Alternatively, this is a good opportunity for users to escape.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nThe Body Replacement Technique can evidently only be used in response to what would be harmful attacks: [[Pain]] only escapes from [[Jiraiya]]'s [[Wild Lion's Mane Technique]] when Jiraiya tries to kill him with it; when Jiraiya uses the same technique to only keep Pain restrained, Pain remains captured.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 374, page 15</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique is based on a real-life ninja art, [[wiktionary:kawarimi|kawarimi]], where ninja substitute themselves with anything that can be mistaken for them (such as a dummy or a mannequin).\n** As it means \"a quick shift in position, or adaptability to changing circumstances\", it is also utilised in [[Wikipedia:Sumo|Sumo]].  \n* In other series, abilities similar to the Body Replacement Technique are sometimes referred to as the {{translation|\"Empty Cicada Technique\"|空蝉の術|Utsusemi no Jutsu}} (not to be confused with the [[Empty Cicada Shell Technique]], which uses the exact same kanji). This name refers to the empty shell a [[wikipedia:cicada|cicada]] leaves after moulting.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2]]'' and subsequent games in the series, [[Killer B]] uses the [[Eight-Tails]]' severed tentacles to mask his escapes.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2]]'', [[Akamaru]] substitutes himself with a bone rather than a block of wood.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Kawarimi no Jutsu]]\n[[es:Jutsu: Reemplazo de Cuerpo]]\n[[fr:Technique de Permutation]]\n[[it:Tecnica della Sostituzione del Corpo]]\n[[pl:Kawarimi no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Substituição]]\n[[ro:Tehnica de Substituție]]\n[[ru:Техника Подмены Тела]]\n[[uk:Хисло тілозаміщення]]"
