Torii were traditionally made from wood or stone, but today they can also be made of reinforced concrete, copper, stainless steel, or other materials. They are usually either unpainted or painted vermilion with a black upper lintel. Located in Kyoto, [[wikipedia:Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari-taisha]], which is the head shrine of the Shintō [[wikipedia:kami|kami]] [[wikipedia:Inari Ōkami|Inari]], is very well known to hold thousands of such torii.\n* When this seal was made, Kurama made an allusion to the [[Sage of Six Paths]], but never finished its statement.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 499, page 15</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Sage Art: Gate of the Great God]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Sceau du Torii]]\n[[pl:Pieczęć Torii]]\n[[ru:Печать Тории]]"
