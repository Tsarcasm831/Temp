Creating even a single shadow clone will require half of a user's [[chakra]], for which reason the normal Shadow Clone Technique is generally only safe to use for [[jōnin]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 100, page 5</ref> Because of how many clones are created with the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the chakra cost is far greater, rendering it unsafe to use for most people other than the [[Hokage]]. For this reason, the [[First Hokage]] declared it [[kinjutsu|forbidden]] and hid it away in the [[Scroll of Seals]]. [[Naruto Uzumaki]] is among the few exceptions to this rule because of the [[Nine-Tails|sheer amount]] of chakra he has access to.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nThere is no established number of created clones separating the regular Shadow Clone Technique from the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. Average users tend to make no more than five shadow clones at a time with the regular version, whereas Naruto will make dozens, hundreds, or [[Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo|sometimes]] even a thousand with the Multiple version. ''[[Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day]]'' takes it in the opposite direction, showing Naruto use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique yet only managing to make two clones because of how tired he is. Naruto sometimes doesn't even differentiate between the two techniques, simply saying \"Shadow Clone Technique\" regardless of how many clones he creates.\n\nWhereas a small number of clones can be useful in a variety of ways, the huge number of clones created for this technique are almost exclusively used offensively, overwhelming opponents with countless attacks from all around.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 684</ref> Naruto also utilises the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while creating the [[Wind Release: Rasengan]], completing years' worth of training within a matter of days.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 319</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* At the end of [[Prologue — Land of Waves]], [[Kakashi]] claims to not have enough chakra to defeat [[Gatō]]'s thugs. Despite this, he performs a {{translation|\"Kakashi Version\"|カカシVer.}} Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, creating dozens of copies of himself and scaring the thugs away.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 33, page 9</ref>\n* In ''[[Kakashi Hiden]]'', while waiting for his new arm, Naruto creates shadow clones with a one-handed seal: a cross with his left hand's index and middle finger. \n* In the anime, when [[Hōki (Watari)|Hōki]] claims to be using the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, he is actually using the [[Haze Clone Technique]].<ref>''Naruto'' episode 167</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Boruto Uzumaki]] pretends to use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique by having his classmates [[transform]] into him.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 37</ref>\n** He later uses the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique through the [[Shinobi Gauntlet]],<ref>''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''</ref> and then by himself against Deepa.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 175</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Multiple Wood Release Clone Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[fr:Multi Clonage Supra]]\n[[he:ג'וטסו העתקי צל המוניים]]\n[[id:Teknik Klon Bayangan Ganda]]\n[[pl:Tajū Kage Bunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[ru:Техника множественного теневого клонирования]]"
