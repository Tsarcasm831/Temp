These flower-like constructs will rapidly grow and into a massive barrier in order to trap whatever is within its perimeter. Enemies trapped inside hindered by the labyrinth's reflective nature as it can generate mirror images of the routes, paths, and other details within its confines, confusing and disorienting them. It is even capable of confusing the [[Byakugan]]. Until it is broken, the barrier cannot be discerned from within.\n\nBecause of the crystal's stable molecular structure, a simple attack focused at one point is rendered useless, and its wide surface will disperse the force of wide range attacks, reducing their effectiveness. To overcome this technique, an [[Wind Release: Toad Gun|attack that has impact force both wide and powerful]] is required to smash through it from the outside.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although the technique is called \"Jade-Crystal Labyrinth\", the gigantic labyrinth itself is ''red'' in colouration. \n\n[[es:Elemento Cristal: Técnica del Laberinto de Cristal de Jade]]\n[[fr:Shôton - Labyrinthe de Cristal]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Cristal: Técnica do Labirinto Cristal de Jade]]\n[[pl:Shōton: Suishō Meikyū no Jutsu]]"
