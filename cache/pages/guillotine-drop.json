This technique is preferably done right after knocking an opponent down to reduce their reaction time as the user cannot use the [[Body Flicker Technique]] to increase their speed in mid-air nor can they use it to dodge counter-attacks in mid-air.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* As with many of the techniques of A, his brother [[Killer B]]'s [[Lightning Release: Lariat]], and [[Darui]]'s [[Storm Release: Laser Circus]], this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as ''Giraichin Doraifu''.\n* [[Wikipedia:Professional wrestling throws#Guillotine drop|Guillotine drop]] is the name of an attack used in professional wrestling.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Heavenly Foot of Pain]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Guillotina]]\n[[fr:Guillotine Drop]]\n[[pl:Girochin Doroppu]]\n[[pt-br:Queda da Guilhotina]]"
