Once they were removed, he could create enough to cover the gigantic [[Ten-Tails (Kara)|Ten-Tails]], and manipulate them into pinching off pieces of the beast into [[Claw Grime]].<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 72, pages 32-35</ref> He can also use them as makeshift bandages to staunch bleeding.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 15, page 26</ref>\n\nRemoval of Claw Marks may be difficult, as [[Shikamaru Nara]] had to request [[Kawaki]] to use [[Sukunahikona]] to shrink them to unusable sizes.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 70, page 30</ref>\n\n== Drawbacks ==\nClaw Marks are one size fits all; if they are shrunk to a certain size, Code will not be able to move between them, being forced to create new ones.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 67, page 6</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Flying Thunder God Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Marque de Griffe]]\n[[pl:Tsumeato]]\n[[ru:Когтяная Метка]]"
