This technique is similar to [[Chidori Current]] as they both have the effect of shooting lightning currents at their opponent. Its range, unlike that of Chidori Current, is much smaller. Unlike Lightning Cutter it has a smaller current of lightning so it will not completely kill them. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* After acquiring the scroll for this technique it can be set to almost every character, even if their [[Nature Transformation|chakra nature]] isn't lightning.\n* The appearance of this technique is similar to how [[Kakuzu]]'s [[Lightning Release: False Darkness]] appears in the game."
