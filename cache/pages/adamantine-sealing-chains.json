Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.<ref name=\"c498\">''Naruto'' chapter 498</ref> The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the [[Nine-Tails]] would struggle to destroy them.<ref name=\"d4\"/> In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 408</ref> Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 503</ref>\n\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"left\" widths=\"200\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nAdamantine Sealing Chains.png|The chains creating a barrier.\nKurama sealed within Kushina.png|The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.\n</gallery>\nA [[barrier]] can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: [[Kushina Uzumaki]] creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the [[Third Hokage]] from entering it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 504</ref> Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' [[jinchūriki]], Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 501</ref> and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.<ref name=\"d4\"/> After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, [[Naruto Uzumaki]], allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.<ref name=\"c498\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], [[Karin]] awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a [[wood]]en opponent. [[Orochimaru]] labels this the same ability as Kushina possessed,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 663</ref> but ''[[Jin no Sho]]'' describes it only as a \"glimpse\" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.<ref name=\"d4\"/>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Beast Sealing Technique]]''\n* [[Demonic Statue Chains]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Clan::Uzumaki clan| ]]\n\n[[es:Cadenas de Chakra]]\n[[fr:Chaînes d'Adamantine de Scellement]]\n[[id:Rantai Wajra Penyegel]]\n[[pl:Kongō Fūsa]]\n[[pt-br:Correntes de Selamento Adamantinas]]"
