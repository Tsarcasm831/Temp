Because there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.<ref name=\"d3\" /> In the anime, it is noted that one requires immense amounts of chakra to create a Big Ball Rasengan at all.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 168</ref>\n\nWhen Naruto first starts using the Big Ball Rasengan, he needs a [[shadow clone]] to help him form and wield it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 260, page 10</ref> He is able to wield it with one hand when his skill with it improves, though he still needs a clone's help in its formation.<ref name=\"ch561\">''Naruto'' chapter 561, page 13</ref>\n\n== Usage and Improvement ==\nLike the original Rasengan, Naruto improved the Big Ball Rasengan and created a [[Spiralling Absorption Sphere|variant]] with his [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode]]. The size and power of his Big Ball Rasengan also improved, with it growing to nearly half the size of the [[Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan]].<ref name=\"ch561\" /> He can also add [[Wind Release]] to it, to create the [[Big Ball Rasenshuriken]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 655, page 15</ref>\n\n== Senjutsu Influence ==\n[[File:Sage Art Big Ball Rasengan.png|thumb|left|Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan.]]\nWhen in [[Sage Mode]], Naruto can use a [[senjutsu]]-enhanced version known as {{translation|'''Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan'''|仙法・大玉螺旋丸|Senpō: Ōdama Rasengan|engtv=Sage Art: Giant Rasengan}}. As with the original, Naruto uses a shadow clone to help him form the ball. With this senjutsu version, however, he can have a shadow clone form a Big Ball Rasengan in each of his hands, which he can then pass to the clones for them to wield. The Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan is much larger than the original, almost being as big as [[Pain]]'s [[Rinnegan Summoning|summons]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 431, page 10</ref>\n{{-L}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Minato Namikaze]]'s standard Rasengan occasionally matches the size of the initial Big Ball Rasengan. In fact, he could use this technique in [[Jiraiya]]'s [[Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero|novel]] within [[Tsunade]]'s [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]] dream.<ref name=\"NS441\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 441</ref>\n** By the end of the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], [[Naruto]]'s regular Rasengan had increased to near Big Ball Rasengan size.\n* When Konohamaru used this technique in an [[Chūnin Exam on Fire! Naruto vs. Konohamaru!|OVA]], he was able to use it with one hand.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[da:Odama Rasengan]]\n[[de:Oodama Rasengan]]\n[[es:Gran Bola Rasengan]]\n[[fr:Orbe Tourbillonnant Géant]]\n[[id:Ōdama Rasengan]]\n[[it:Rasengan Superiore]]\n[[pl:Ōdama Rasengan]]\n[[pt-br:Rasengan Gigante]]\n[[ro:Rasengan Uriaș]]\n[[ru:Большой Шар Расенгана]]\n[[tr:Devasa Rasengan]]"
