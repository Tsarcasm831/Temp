The size of each of these hands is around the size of a [[tailed beast]]. Hashirama is shown to be able to manifest two hands with sheer will alone, without the use of hand seals.\n\n== Influence ==\nThis technique seems to be influenced by {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Budai|Budai]]|布袋|Budai}}, also known as '''Hotei''' in Japanese.

In Japan, Hotei persists in folklore as one of the [[Wikipedia:Seven Lucky Gods|Seven Lucky Gods]] of Taoism.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Desert: Hand]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Mokuton - Étreinte du Bouddha]]\n[[pl:Mokuton: Hotei no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Madeira: Técnica Hotei]]"
