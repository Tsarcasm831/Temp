Guy wields these with great dexterity, utilising all of his limbs at times, making use of them particularly during situations where direct physical contact must be avoided.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 595, pages 9-12</ref> Making use of his own impressive strength, he can even crush large boulders using this technique.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 596</ref>\n\n== Guy's nunchaku ==\nEach handle of these weapons is intricately carved into the shape of a [[Wikipedia:Chinese dragon|Chinese dragon]]-like creature, with scales engraved along their length and a head near the handle's base, while appearing to be linked together by a length of twisted cord. \n\nThe weapons are first seen in use during the later stages of the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]] but, during the course of the confrontation with [[Tobi]], they were soon [[Kamui#Teleportation|absorbed]] by the former.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 596, page 12</ref> After the war, Guy wields a pair of nunchaku once again.<ref>''Naruto'' novel, Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky</ref>  \n\n== Trivia ==\n* In episode 40 of ''[[Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden]]'', Guy can be seen holding a nunchaku with a similar looking design to the ones used for Sōshūga, but with a black colouring.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Soshuga}}\n\n[[de:Soushuuga]]\n[[fr:Sôshûga]]\n[[pl:Sōshūga]]\n[[pt-br:Soushuuga]]"
