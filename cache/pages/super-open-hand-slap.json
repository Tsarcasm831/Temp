The weight and power of the hands are greatly increased because of the larger size, the muscles are activated with concentrated chakra, and the thickness is also increased. With so much chakra that it becomes visible, the user's palms become like an iron hammer. This gives this attack the power to even cave in the earth, causing extensive crushing damage to anything that may be caught beneath them. Due to the increased size of their palms, the attack covers a wide range.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* A \"Harite\" is a technique from Sumo wrestling where one slaps the opponent with their open hand.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Akimichi clan| ]]\n\n[[fr:Grande Claque]]\n[[pl:Chōharite]]\n[[pt-br:Super Bofetada]]"
