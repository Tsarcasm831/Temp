The hound is highly fast and its movements are unpredictable, making it is very difficult to avoid. As Kakashi's hand remains connected to the hound by a cord of lightning, adjusting the amount of chakra used for the technique allows him to freely manipulate its speed and range.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Wikipedia:Raijū|Raijū]] is a mythological creature in Shintō religion, companion to the Shintō god of lightning, Raijin. Raijū has many common representations, with a white and blue wolf sometimes engulfed in lightning being among them, akin to the form Kakashi's technique takes.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', Kakashi can only use this technique if [[Lightning Cutter]] is selected as his Ninjutsu attack, as this technique serves as the Lightning Cutter's charged Ninjutsu attack in the game.\n* In multiple Storm titles, this technique is used in conjunction with [[Might Guy]]'s [[Daytime Tiger]] as part of their [[Eternal Rival (Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution)|Combination Ultimate Jutsu]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Lightning Release: Black Panther]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Rayo: Jutsu del Perro Eléctrico]]\n[[fr:Raiton - Crocs Traqueurs de la Bête de Foudre]]\n[[pl:Raiton: Raijū Tsuiga]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Raio: Perseguição de Garras da Besta Relâmpago]]"
