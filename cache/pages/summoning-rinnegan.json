As with the [[Six Paths of Pain]] and the [[King of Hell]], animals summoned through this technique are visually linked to the user's own Rinnegan, offering them a greater field of view. The summons' bodies are also adorned with a number of [[Black Receiver|black piercings]], allowing the user to control them remotely through the use of their [[chakra]]. People summoned with the technique can also be granted a portion of the [[Six Paths Technique]].<ref name=\"d4\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When [[Nagato]] uses this technique, he refers to it simply as \"[[Summoning Technique]]\",<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 374, page 1</ref> whereas [[Kabuto Yakushi]] uses the technique's full title.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 552, page 3</ref>\n* Unlike the usual Summoning Technique, this technique does not appear to require a blood offering.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Invocation Rinnegan]]\n[[pl:Kuchiyose Rinnegan]]\n[[pt-br:Invocação do Rinnegan]]"
