Sora activates it by summoning chakra in his right hand, and then swipes a slicing chakra wave which appears to be controlled by Sora's will and thoughts. He is also able to use the technique in a rapid-fire, successive motion. This technique became stronger when Sora was in the influence of the [[Nine-Tailed Demon Fox]]'s chakra and instead of the usual blue colour, it was red.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Blade of Wind]]\n* [[Wind Release: Vacuum Wave]]\n* [[Wind Release: Wind Cutter Technique]]\n\n[[es:Elemento Viento: Palma de Ola Bestial]]\n[[pl:Jūha Shō]]"
