As an additional defence, it can, when it's being physically attacked, divide its body into countless smaller versions of itself, thus nullifying the attack. The smaller divisions, each one a full-functioning Katsuyu, can recombine when they wish, restoring Katsuyu to its larger size. If a Katsuyu should be attacked again, it can just divide again, repeating the process indefinitely until the attacker gives up.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nEven without being attacked, Katsuyu can create divisions of itself in order to cover a large area, with each division carrying out different tasks, as is done with [[Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 422</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fission Technique]]\n* ''[[Ten-Tails Fission]]''\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique is an exaggerated version of a slug's [[wikipedia:autotomy|autotomy]], where it self-amputates part of its tail to escape predators.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Grande Division de la Limace]]\n[[pl:Katsuyu Daibunretsu]]\n[[pt-br:Grande Divisão da Lesma]]"
