The sand presses in on the target from all directions until they're pulverised, killing them. Although some of the target's remains burst through the sand, scattering around the area similar to rain, most of their blood is absorbed by the sand itself.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nGaara can moderate the amount of pressure used in the sand's contraction, either making death quick and painless or dragging it out to prolong their suffering. He can also stop short of killing his targets, only compressing the sand enough to break their bones.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 86</ref> In this case, however, the damage is so severe that only [[Tsunade]] is skilled enough to mend the bones, and even then she anticipates only a 50% success rate.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 173</ref> In ''[[Gaara Hiden]]'', the Sand Waterfall Funeral is stated to leave no identifiable trace of its victims, making it a useful way to fake a person's death.\n\nIn the anime, [[Shinki]] performs this technique using [[Iron Sand]].<ref>''Boruto'' episode 60</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|\"Sand waterfall\"|砂瀑|sabaku}} is pronounced the same as the Japanese word for {{translation|\"desert\"|砂漠}}, a pun commonly used for Gaara and his jutsu.\n* In the anime, [[Nagare]] modelled his [[Assimilation: Sand Waterfall Funeral]] after this technique.\n\n== References  ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Funeral de la Cascada de Arena]]\n[[fr:Tombeau du Désert]]\n[[pl:Sabaku Sōsō]]\n[[pt-br:Enterro de Areia]]"
