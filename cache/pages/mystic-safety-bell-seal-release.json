She releases power through her [[Bell (charm)|bell]], and completely transforms. This allows her to send a huge ray of light which can penetrate [[Mōryō]]'s darkness. In this form, she has the ability to, and attempted to, completely destroy Mōryō along with herself. She was pulled out by [[Naruto]] before she could do so.\n\n[[es:Cascabel Místico Protector: Liberar]]\n[[pl:Pieczęć Mistycznego Dzwonka Bezpieczeństwa: Uwolnienie]]\n[[pt-br:Super Shion]]"
