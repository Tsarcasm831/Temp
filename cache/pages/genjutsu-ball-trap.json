It was created from a dangerous bubble-like substance that traps victims in a [[genjutsu]] dream, where they live out their memories.\n\nIt also has two known forms. Its immature form is simply enormous bubble-like substance, and its mature form appears like a ball made from a quartz-like substance from outside, however if anyone plunged into the ball, they will be trapped into a space that reflects and their memories for a near indefinite time, shutting them away in their own memories.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the novelisation, [[Shikamaru]] decides to call this technique {{translation|\"Bubble Release\"|泡遁|Awaton}}.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]]\n\n[[fr:Bulles de Genjutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Armadilha de Genjutsu]]"
