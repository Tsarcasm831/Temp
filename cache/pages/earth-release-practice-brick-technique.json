After forming the necessary [[hand seal]]s, the user places their hands on the ground and creates a solid wall to serve as a defensive barricade, manipulating pre-existing earth to rise up and take form. Though weak, these walls can serve as a makeshift blockade when formed by several users, slowing down large and powerful attacks. Using this technique is apparently extremely simple, to the point where it can be taught to even non-primary Earth Release users in a matter of seconds.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Earth Release: Earth Shore Return]]\n* [[Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Pared de Tierra]]\n[[fr:Doton - Barrière de Terre]]\n[[pl:Doton: Renga no Jutsu]]"
