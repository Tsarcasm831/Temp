The Byakugan seemingly grants him immense power, which he claimed to be capable of bringing about the end of the world. However, the true power of this technique is never shown as he was exposed to sunlight, affecting the [[chakra]] in the Byakugan and surpassing his chakra capacity limit, making the technique highly unstable and impossible to control. The sunlight also caused the technique to go berserk and mutate the user into an unstable white mass with a large mouth protruding from the back, which would lead to Toneri either melting or exploding.<ref>''The Last: Naruto the Movie'' novel</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Clan::Ōtsutsuki Clan| ]]\n\n[[pt-br:Reencarnação da Marionete]]\n[[pl:Kugutsu Tensei]]"
