When extracted, the beast initially takes the form of pure chakra, also causing the host to go into a near Version 1-like state. After being extracted, the beast takes a corporeal form. Obito Uchiha waited until [[Kushina Uzumaki]]'s seal was weak enough to use this technique to extract [[Kurama]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 501, page 7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie]]'', Tobi — through [[Menma]] — can be seen extracting Kurama from Naruto with his [[Sharingan]] alone, without binding him with this fūinjutsu first.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals]]\n* ''[[Tailed Beast Removal Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pl:Kaibi Hōin]]\n[[fr:Méthode de Libération du Démon]]"
