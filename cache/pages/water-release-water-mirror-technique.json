Its surface acts like a mirror, perfectly reflecting the attacking targets. By then hooking onto and rotating the \"mirror\" 90° with their [[Wikipedia:Staff (stick)|staff]], the reflections emerge and materialise from the mirror, where they collide with the mirrored targets. As these reflections use the exact same [[technique]] as their counterpart — regardless of its type — they counter the attack completely, while repelling them in the process. However, upon impact, the reflections disperse into water.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{Translation|''Mizukagami''|水鏡}} is a normal Japanese word referring to a reflective surface of water.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Mirrored Sudden Attacker Technique]]\n* [[Water Clone Technique]]\n* [[Moon Shadow Technique]]\n* [[Water Release: Clear Mirror Still Water]]\n* [[Water Mirror Colliding Bullets]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Suiton - Miroir d'Eau]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Mizukagami no Jutsu]]"
