The jinchūriki is bound to a rock table surrounded by a large circular sealing formula with several ceremonial rocks surrounding it. During the extraction process, the jinchuriki experiences extreme pain as the beast is ripped from their body.\n\n[[Harusame]] attempted to use this technique to extract [[Saiken]] from its jinchūriki, [[Utakata]]. During the extraction process, Utakata slipped into the beast's [[Tailed Beast Mode|full form]] and ended up killing Harusame.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Because Harusame wished to free Utakata of the burden of being the host of the Six-Tails, it is possible this technique was created as a means to extract a tailed beast without ending the life of the jinchūriki.\n* The place where Saiken was being extracted from Utakata by Harusame from resembles a [[Wikipedia:Stonehenge|Stonehenge]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals]]\n* [[Tail Releasing Method]]\n\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Remoção de Bijū]]"
