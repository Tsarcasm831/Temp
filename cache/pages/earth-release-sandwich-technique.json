As the size of the formations can be regulated by the amount of chakra used to create and maintain it,<ref name=\"d4\" /> the technique was capable of dwarfing even the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]] in size and reaching heights large enough to temporarily trap the [[Ten-Tails]]. [[Kitsuchi]] stated that this was his strongest technique, standing as a testament to both this ability's destructive potential and its difficulty. \n\nIn the anime, it was shown that the technique can be used on a smaller scale against a group of enemies.<ref name=\"ship320\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 320</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Earth Release: Bedrock Coffin]]\n* ''[[Earth Release: Lithic Press]]''\n* [[Earth Release: Ground Bedrock]]\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The word ''sando'' is a Japanese abbreviation for the English word ''sandwich''. The technique is written with the kanji for \"mountain\" and \"earth\", both pronounced with their onyomi, while they would usually be pronounced with their kunyomi as \"yamatsuchi\".\n* Each half of the rock formation has the symbol of [[Iwagakure]] inscribed upon it. Though, in the anime, the rock formations initially didn't have any details like the Iwagakure symbol etched onto it. They were added in a later episode.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Choque de Montañas]]\n[[fr:Doton - Montagne de Terre]]\n[[pl:Doton: Sando no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Terra: Técnica Sanduíche]]"
