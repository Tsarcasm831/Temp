Whilst the technique has the additional advantage of potentially being extremely difficult to detect, its use consumes a great amount of chakra.<ref name=\"C390\">''Naruto'' chapter 390, page 16</ref> The technique can seemingly be used no matter how serious the injury, as Orochimaru was able to use it to materialise a new body even after Kabuto cut his throat open and grievously injured his body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 584, page 14</ref>\n\nWhen used by Kabuto Yakushi, who showed a more versatile use of this technique, he was able to shed his human form to reveal a humanoid-like form complete with a serpentine body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 514, pages 11-14</ref> He later appeared with a similar serpentine body with what seemed to be smaller limbs.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 514, page 17</ref> He would later use this technique to shed his body during battle as a means of taking his opponent by surprise.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 586, page 10</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The technique and its nature of normally negating near-fatal injuries play with the cultural symbolism of snakes as symbols of immortality and rebirth via the shedding of their skin.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Snake Charmer Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Muda de Cuerpo]]\n[[fr:Technique de Permutation d'Orochimaru]]\n[[pl:Orochimaru-Ryū no Kawarimi no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Substituição ao Estilo do Orochimaru]]"
