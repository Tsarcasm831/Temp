The water in the clone is surrounded by a thin layer of oil and due to this structure, the clone's temperature can easily be altered from cold to hot and vice-versa. When it exerts itself, the outer layer of oil heats up and evaporates the water inside. As the internal pressure builds, the clone expands until it [[Wikipedia:Explosion#Mechanical and vapor|violently explodes]] and the water vapour is released. The force of the explosion is great enough to completely destroy even [[Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal|durable constructs]]. This vapour then cools down as it rises and as a result, turns into [[Wikipedia:Hail|hail]] that cools the clone, causing it to shrink to its original size and start the entire process again.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 557, pages 1-3</ref>\n\nDespite its constantly increasing size, the clone itself remains very fast throughout the technique, enough to elude even Gaara's chakra-infused [[sand]]. This high-speed movement also allows it to heat up very quickly and to more easily inflict damage using an axe-like liquid blade that it is able to form on its arm. Throughout the duration of this technique, the Mizukage becomes weakened and vulnerable.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 557, pages 4-5</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name of this technique and its use of a \"youthful\" clone of the Second might be a reference to the famous Japanese animation film ''[[Wikipedia:Steamboy|Steamboy]]'', as the 'bōi' part is probably meant to imply the English word \"boy\" and \"jōki\" simply means \"steam\" when written as \"蒸気\".\n* The continuous cycle of this attack is very similar to that of the [[Wikipedia:Water cycle|water cycle]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[C4]]\n* [[Clone Great Explosion]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Brumes du Tyran]]\n[[pl:Jōki Bōi]]\n[[pt-br:Tirania Fumegante Perigosa]]"
