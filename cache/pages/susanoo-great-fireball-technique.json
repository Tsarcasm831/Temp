The fireballs vary in size, capable of becoming as large as a [[Tailed Beast]]. As the technique doesn't explode on impact, the fireballs can be repelled with enough force. By launching the technique into the sky, it creates thunderclouds, making it possible to use [[Kirin]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique]]\n\n\n[[Clan::Uchiha Clan| ]]"
