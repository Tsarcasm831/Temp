With focus the user can communicate with multiple people at once and the targets can also communicate with one another while the technique is in effect.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 529, page 11</ref> \n\nThis technique is not limited to just transmitting thoughts. Images, such as memories, or even strong feelings can be conveyed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 647, pages 16-21</ref> The more people that are connected through this technique however, the more a physical strain is put on the user, forcing them to keep the connection going for shorter periods to otherwise avoid sustaining injuries. \n\nDepending on the skill of the user, one may require the aid of [[Chakra Transmission Communication Device|a device]] to make use of this technique for connections to multiple people as Inoichi's usage to connect with the entire [[Allied Shinobi Forces]] for more than ten seconds caused him to suffer a nosebleed.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Event Recording]]''\n* [[Outer Path]]\n* [[Tailed Beast Telepathy]]\n* ''[[Wave Transmission Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Yamanaka clan| ]]\n\n[[fr:Télépathie]]\n[[pl:Shindenshin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Transmissão de Mentes]]\n[[ru:Техника Передачи Сознания Тела]]"
