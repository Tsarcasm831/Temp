It is a barrier created by oneself that is impossible for anyone to step past, though it can only be used by those blessed with [[Six Paths#Powers|Six Paths Power]].<ref name=\"d4\"/> When [[Obito Uchiha]] uses this technique, the [[Truth-Seeking Ball]] floating behind his right hand is engulfed in red flame-like chakra, at which point he launches six black rods from his hand, each surrounded by the same red chakra. The rods strike the ground at six points in his surroundings, and once the necessary [[hand seal]]s are performed, they serve as the origin points for a gigantic red barrier.<ref name=\"ch643\">''Naruto'' chapter 643, pages 9-11</ref>\n\nLike its smaller counterpart, the barrier is highly malleable, being capable of withstanding the explosion of [[Resonance Blast|four enormous]] [[Tailed Beast Ball]]s derived from the power of the [[Ten-Tails]] by dispersing their force upwards and into the sky.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 644, pages 8-10</ref> However, as with similar techniques, the barrier can still be bypassed through the use of [[space–time ninjutsu]] such as the [[Flying Thunder God Technique]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 644, pages 12-13</ref> The barrier's creator can also deactivate it at will, as well as apparently reactivate it at a later time if necessary.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 646, page 1</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When Obito used this technique in the manga, the Truth-Seeking Ball behind his right hand permanently disappeared, implying it was converted into the black rods used to form the barrier.<ref name=\"ch643\"/> However, in the anime, the orb remained after this technique's activation.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 380</ref>\n* The [[Jin no Sho|fourth databook]] makes no mention of this technique involving a Truth-Seeking Ball, instead stating that it utilises the [[Rinnegan]]'s trademark [[black receiver]]s.<ref name=\"d4\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Museki Youjin]]\n[[es:Formación de los Seis Yang Rojos]]\n[[fr:Hexaèdre aux Faces Écarlates]]\n[[it:Schema dei Sei Astri]]\n[[pl:Musekiyōjin]]\n[[pt-br:Formação dos Seis Sóis Vermelhos]]\n[[uk:Формація Шести Червоних Ян]]"
