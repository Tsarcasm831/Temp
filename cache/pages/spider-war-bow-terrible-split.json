Because of how much power is put into each arrow, they travel incredibly quickly, too fast to see.<ref name=\"d2\"/> On impact, the arrows pierce cleanly through targets and obstacles alike and can crater the ground,<ref name=\"c196\">''Naruto'' chapter 196</ref> to the point that it is described as a \"one hit kill\". By activating his [[Orochimaru's Juinjutsu|cursed seal]]'s second level, Kidōmaru gains a third eye which further increases his accuracy, allowing him to hit his target's vital spots from hundreds of metres away.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nWhen fighting [[Neji Hyūga]], Kidōmaru initially uses a standard arrow without any special properties. By surrounding the area with his [[chakra]], Neji is able to sense to arrow in time to avoid fatal injury.<ref name=\"c196\"/> To account for this, Kidōmaru attaches one of his usual spider threads to the arrow, allowing him to control its trajectory from up to fifty metres and thus improve its accuracy.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Neji takes shelter behind a tree to throw the arrow off course. To account for this, Kidōmaru modifies the arrowhead into a drill, which will allow it to pierce through the tree if Neji tries that again.<ref name=\"c196\"/> The combination of the new arrow and the guiding thread is enough to successfully strike Neji, which Neji uses as an opportunity to locate and [[Gentle Fist|kill]] Kidōmaru.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 197</ref> In the anime, after being [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]], Kidōmaru can simultaneously fire three arrows.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 305</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique's Japanese name is a pun, as when written as {{Translation|Suzaku|朱雀|lit meaning=[[Wikipedia:Vermilion Bird|Vermilion Bird]]}}, it is one of the sacred beasts of the [[Wikipedia:Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] in Chinese, Japanese and Korean mythology.\n* While the databook states Kidōmaru boosts the tension of the bow with his eight spider limbs, which was what he did against Neji for the first shot, the next two shots he fired were only using two arms, despite retaining the same destructive force behind them.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Arco de Guerra de Araña: Ruptura Terrible]]\n[[fr:Arc de Guerre de l'Araignée - Scission Terrible]]\n[[pl:Kumo Senkyū: Suzaku]]\n[[pt-br:Arco da Aranha: Grande Dilaceração]]"
