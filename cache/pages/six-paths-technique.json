Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.<ref name=\"ch449\">''Naruto'' chapter 449, pages 1-2</ref> Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:\n\n* The {{translation|[[Deva Path]]|天道|Tendō}}, which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.\n* The {{translation|[[Asura Path]]|修羅道|Shuradō}}, which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.\n* The {{translation|[[Human Path]]|人間道|Ningendō}}, which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.\n* The {{translation|[[Animal Path]]|畜生道|Chikushōdō}}, which allows the user to [[Summoning Technique|summon]] a wide variety of creatures.\n* The {{translation|[[Preta Path]]|餓鬼道|Gakidō}}, which is capable of absorbing all forms of [[chakra]], including most ninjutsu.\n* The {{translation|[[Naraka Path]]|地獄道|Jigokudō}}, through which the user can call upon the [[King of Hell]].\n* The {{translation|[[Outer Path]]|外道|Gedō}}, with which the user is able to preside over life and death.\n\n[[Nagato]], who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the [[Six Paths of Pain]]: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of [[black receiver]]s. These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations. The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.<ref name=\"ch449\" /> [[Obito Uchiha]] would later make use of this method to create his own Six Paths of Pain, this time using six former [[jinchūriki]] that were [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]] by [[Kabuto Yakushi]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 544, pages 16-17</ref>\n\nAs the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk. However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale [[Shinra Tensei]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 429, page 10</ref> or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of [[Chibaku Tensei]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 438, page 17</ref> In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 551, page 10</ref> It also does not seem that the user is able to change the Path being utilised by each body, as once each of Nagato's Six Paths were taken down, he could not channel any of their powers through the remaining vessels.\n\n== Influences ==\nThe Six Paths share their names with the [[Wikipedia:Desire realm|six realms of reincarnation]] in Buddhism: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these \"paths\" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated [[Wikipedia:Karma|karma]] of their past lives. While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate [[Wikipedia:Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Saṃsāra]], the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\n\nThe Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term ''[[Wikipedia:Tīrthika|Tīrthika]]'', refers to any doctrine that \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the {{translation|''Naidō''|内道|lit meaning=Inner Path}}, and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite neither possessing the Rinnegan at the time, [[Madara Uchiha]] taught Obito to use the Six Paths Technique, alongside [[Uchiha]] [[kinjutsu]] and [[Yin–Yang Release]] techniques, shortly prior to his death. He then created a [[Black Receiver|black rod]] out of his [[Will Materialisation|will]] and told Obito to use it when he performed the Six Paths Technique.<ref name=\"ch606\" />\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble]]'', a technique called \"Six Paths Technique\" is used by Nagato's Six Paths of Pain. In this variant, Nagato generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor. An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called {{translation|\"Six Paths Technique: Collapse\"|六道の術・崩壊|Rikudō no Jutsu: Hōkai}} can also be performed.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Seis Caminos]]\n[[fr:Technique de Rikudô]]\n[[id:Teknik Enam Jalan]]\n[[pl:Rikudō no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Jutsu do Seis Caminhos]]"
