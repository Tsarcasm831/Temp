After completing the necessary hand signs, the scrolls rise up and spin around each other cloaked in smoke shaped like a dragon. When the smoke disperses, Tenten jumps in between the scrolls and starts to unseal and throw weapons at her opponent in quick succession. If her opponent deflects or dodges the attack, she can use the [[wire strings]] [[Manipulated Shuriken Technique|attached to the weapons]] to recover them for another attack.\n\nDuring the time-skip, Tenten made some improvements to this technique. She no longer has to waste her time grabbing and throwing the weapons, as she can send them flying with just a movement of her hand. As such, she can unseal more weapons at a time, allowing her to attack at a much faster rate. She also adds [[explosive tag]]s to her [[kunai]] to make her attacks more lethal.\n\n[[fr:Dragons Jumeaux]]\n[[pl:Sōshōryū]]\n[[pt-br:Dragões Gêmeos Ascendentes]]"
