The walls of the dome have [[chakra]] flowing within, which quickly repairs any damage that its prisoners may do to it. If the user remains in contact with the dome, they are able to [[absorb]] the chakra of those who are imprisoned, making them weaker over time; [[Jirōbō]] likes to do this in order to gain sustenance from his enemies.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Although the dome is difficult to escape from, it isn't impossible: the chakra within its walls isn't evenly distributed, being at its thinnest on the side of the dome opposite to where the user is standing. If the prisoners can ascertain where this weak spot is and then focus a sufficiently powerful attack on it, they will be able to break out.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 187</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|Dorō|土牢}} means \"Earth Prison\". However, the usual pronunciation of these kanji is \"tsuchirō\", meaning \"dungeon\". Likewise, {{translation|dōmu|堂無}} is written with the kanji for \"Magnificent Nothingness\", but, when written in katakana (ドーム), it means \"dome\".\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Ice Release: Ice Rock Dome of Magnificent Nothingness]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Domo Barrera de Tierra]]\n[[fr:Doton - Geôle de Terre]]\n[[pl:Doton Kekkai: Dorō Dōmu]]\n[[pt-br:Barreira Estilo Terra: Prisão Cúpula de Terra]]"
