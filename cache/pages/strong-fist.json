It is the exact opposite of [[Gentle Fist]] which is used mainly by the [[Hyūga Clan]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 79, page 8</ref> This style of fighting involves smashing your opponent and is generally used only by extremely physically powerful and dominating shinobi. As shown by Sasuke's initial usage of this style, the user must be exceptionally conditioned or even a brief performance in this style will quickly exhaust and strain the body. It was only after a month of training that Sasuke later became able to use this style unhindered.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Sasuke and Kakashi do not actually practise<!-- practise=verb, practice=noun --> this style, but they use the key elements and a few techniques that were copied with their [[Sharingan]] from Rock Lee and Might Guy.\n* Naruto uses this style in ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2]]'' as \"Taijutsu Naruto\", in ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3]]'' as \"The Green Beast\" and in ''[[Naruto: Shippūden]]'' [[Ah, the Medicine of Youth|episode 186]].\n* Naruto and Kakashi also imitate this style in ''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]''.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Wikipedia:Styles of Chinese martial arts#External styles|'''External''' Martial Art Style]] - Martial art styles that emphasise on the refinement of the body and physical prowess.\n* [[Wikipedia:Hard and soft (martial arts)#Hard techniques|'''Hard''' Martial Art Style]] - Martial art styles that teach techniques that involve meeting and countering an opponent's incoming force with equal and/or overwhelming force.\n* [[Wikipedia:Koppōjutsu|Koppōjutsu]] - Literally means \"''Attacks against bones technique''\".
