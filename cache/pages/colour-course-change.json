She needs to do this because of her [[Execution by Kiss]] technique: since a single body couldn't handle so much chakra, she had to use several to distribute all the chakra she had sucked during her life. Bringing out a [[scroll]], she obscures her body in a quick movement, and switches into another body. Due to the bodies being made to share the same appearance, new bodies will appear unscathed, which can be used to create the illusion that Fūka can somehow heal herself. Destroyed bodies crumble into dust, causing the next body to replace it. Each body possesses a unique combination of [[Nature Transformation|elemental affinities]]. However, since she housed her soul within her hair, and that the hair was the same for all bodies, damage inflicted to that will be permanent.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Living Corpse Reincarnation]]\n\n[[es:Cambio del Curso de Color]]\n[[fr:Danse de Régénération Macabre]]\n[[pl:Shiki Tenshin]]"
