This technique uses [[shape transformation]] to form the original Chidori into a spear or blade-shape, adapting it for mid-range attacks with a maximum range of about five metres.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 358, page 5</ref> Its increased range means there is less of a risk to the user. It also has the advantage of being able to be used for surprise attacks and capturing. \n\nWhen the enemy's body is pierced, the user can alter the spear's shape into multiple additional blades, increasing the number of wounds.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 367, page 5</ref> The blade can also be swung in order to cut things as well as cause fatal injuries. Sasuke has shown that he can also channel this technique through his [[Sword of Kusanagi (Sasuke Uchiha)|chokutō]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 634, pages 8-9</ref> \n\nBecause of Sasuke's mastery in kenjutsu, this technique can act as a makeshift sword if he loses his sword.\n\nAfter infusing this technique with [[Six Paths Chakra]], Sasuke was able to bisect through the [[Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique|revived]] [[Madara]] in his [[Jinchūriki Forms|jinchūriki form]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, page 15</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the [[Naruto: Shippūden|anime]], this technique was shown off-screen before its proper début.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 89</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Chidori Eisō]]\n[[fr:Lance Acérée du Chidori]]\n[[pl:Chidori Eisō]]\n[[pt-br:Lança de Chidori]]"
