The user can then trap their opponent within the ice by controlling its movements and completely surrounding them in the ice. It is strong enough to withstand basic [[Fire Release]] techniques, because the ice has already been infused with the user's chakra. The user can also surround themselves with the ice prison to act as a shield.\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Prisión de Hielo]]\n[[pl:Hyōrō no Jutsu]]"
