Though Gyūki is the sole inheritor of the ability, it can be passed on to its [[jinchūriki]].\n\n== Jinchūriki Usage ==\n* Killer B has made use of the ink by ejecting it from his mouth to blind an opponent or to create [[ink clone]]s that can be used to [[Sealing Technique: Octopus Hold|seal]] targets. Killer B has also made a more practical use of the ink by placing some of it on his finger to use as a makeshift pencil.\n* Naruto Uzumaki has made use of the ink by mixing it into his [[Wind Release: Rasenshuriken]] while in [[Six Paths Sage Mode]]. Whether the ink is ejected from his mouth or formed from thin air is unknown.\n\n[[es:Tinta Saliva]]\n[[fr:Création d'Encre]]\n[[pl:Stworzenie Atramentu]]\n[[pt-br:Tinta Preta]]\n[[ru:Сотворение Чернил]]"
