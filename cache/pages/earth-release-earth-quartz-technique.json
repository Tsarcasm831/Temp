Doing so negates the effects of [[Lightning Release]], which earth is ordinarily weak to. Originally conceived as a theoretical possibility by a scientist, the technique was long considered to be impossible for actual use in the field: first there was the issue of being able convert earth to glass at all, which would require years of training just to achieve the necessary purity; there was the issue of anticipating where a lightning-based attack would strike and then accurately converting that location in time; and the glass would subsequently need to be changed back into earth, as glass is otherwise a weak material. Despite all this, [[Kakashi Hatake]] is able to do so, converting sections of his [[Earth-Style Wall]] that are about to be struck by lightning. He notes that the ability is ineffective against high concentrations of lightning, such as [[Chidori]], because the heat that's generated would melt the glass. [[Sasuke Uchiha]] used this technique to create a glass [[Kunai]] from a piece of rock.\n\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Quartzo Terrestre]]"
