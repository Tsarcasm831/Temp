The user converts chakra in their body into a special chemical that they then exhale from their mouth. When the chemical comes into contact with the air, it becomes a cloud of poison. Breathing in even a small amount of the poison will cause immediate death.<ref name=d2/>\n\nThe Poison Mist used by [[Ibuse]] differs from that used by [[Shizune]]. Rather than kill those that inhale it, Ibuse's causes victims to become paralysed after only a few seconds, allowing [[Hanzō]] to attack them at his leisure with his [[Wikipedia:Kusarigama|kusarigama]]. Ibuse must first generate and store the poison within his body for five minutes before he can use it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 531, page 8</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3]]'', almost every character can use this technique by finding a Poison Book for Shizune.\n* In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'', \"[[Ibuse's Poison Mist]]\" is part of [[Hanzō]]'s moveset.\n\n== See Also == \n* [[Snake Mouth Poison Mist Technique]]\n* [[Poison Cloud Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Niebla Venenosa]]\n[[fr:Nuage de Poison]]\n[[pl:Dokugiri]]\n[[pt-br:Névoa Venenosa]]"
