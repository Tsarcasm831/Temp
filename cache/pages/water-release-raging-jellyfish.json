With its tentacles, it can cause widespread destruction and attack multiple targets at once. Funamushi only employed it in combat when he had access to a significant amount of water provided by rainfall. Despite his Water Release being vulnerable to [[Lightning Release]], especially when absorbing water to use jutsu, once it was used, it appeared to suffer no effect from three simultaneous Lightning Release attacks.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Cat God Possession: Monster Cat Beckoning Technique]]\n* [[Susanoo]]\n* [[Wood Release: Wood Human Technique]]"
