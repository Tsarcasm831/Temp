In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 128, page 11</ref> which he increases to an unspecified number in Part II. During Part II, Kakashi demonstrates several new uses for the Lightning Cutter, such as forming one in each hand to counteract [[Lightning Release: False Darkness|powerful lightning attacks]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 334, page 16</ref> On another occasion, he [[Lightning Transmission|link]]s his Lightning Cutter with one of his [[shadow clone]]'s, using the arc of electricity to cut through multiple targets.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 568, pages 4-5</ref> He can also [[flow]] it into [[kunai]], enhancing its slicing power and giving him a method of throwing the Lightning Cutter.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 595, pages 17-18</ref>\n\t\n== Six Paths Application ==\n[[File:Kamui Lightning Cutter.png|thumb|left|Kakashi's Lightning Cutter infused with the Six Paths Power.]]\nWhile Kakashi's body is briefly inhabited by the spirit of [[Obito Uchiha]], he applies [[Six_Paths#Powers|Six Paths Power]] to his Lightning Cutter, allowing it to damage [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]]. He [[Kamui Lightning Cutter|combine]]s this usage with [[Kamui]], causing her counterattacks to pass through him harmlessly.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 689, pages 9-10</ref>\n{{-L}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* After losing his Sharingan as a result of [[Madara Uchiha]] stealing it during the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], Kakashi no longer uses Lightning Cutter for safety reasons due to being unable to compensate for tunnel vision in his eyes. To counter this, in ''[[Kakashi Hiden]]'', Kakashi developed a new signature technique, [[Lightning Release: Purple Electricity]], which functions similarly to Lightning Cutter, albeit can be used safely without the Sharingan.\n* The name Raikiri comes from a story about famous samurai, [[Wikipedia:Tachibana Dōsetsu|Tachibana Dōsetsu]]: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called {{translation|Chidori|千鳥|lit meaning=A Thousand Birds}}. One day, while taking shelter from the rain under a tree, a bolt of lightning struck him. However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the [[Wikipedia:Raijin|Thunder God]] inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive. After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to {{translation|Raikiri|雷切|lit meaning=Lightning Cutter}}.\n* In the anime, the Lightning Cutter is usually depicted as blue, whereas the Chidori is depicted as white.\n* In ''[[Kakashi Retsuden]]'', Kakashi encounters [[Hakubi Shin]], a rogue ninja from [[Konohagakure]] who claims to be able to use the Lightning Cutter. Although the technique is similar in appearance and how it's used, it's only an imitation that lacks the Lightning Cutter's raw power.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire]]'', when this technique was copied by [[Hiruko (missing-nin)|Hiruko]], he used the electrical energy to surge around the area, increasing the range of damage.\n* In the crossover comic series ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Naruto]]'', Kakashi performs a [[cooperation ninjutsu]] with [[w:c:turtlepedia:Leonardo (TMNT x Naruto)|Leonardo]] utilising the Lightning Cutter called '''Lightning Katana'''.<ref>''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Naruto'' Issue 3, page 18</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hell Stab]]\n* [[Nadeshiko-Style Hardliner Gale Fist]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Raikiri]]\n[[es:Cortador de Relámpago]]\n[[fr:Éclair Pourfendeur]]\n[[id:Pemotong Petir]]\n[[ka:ელვის მჭრელი]]\n[[pl:Raikiri]]\n[[pt-br:Raikiri]]\n[[ru:Стихия Молнии: Райкири]]"
