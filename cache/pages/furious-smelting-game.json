He flashes past them, binding them in chains, and throwing them back to and through the ground. He pulls them back up, and throws a manifest trident at them, breaking the chains, and hammers them back down. Finally, he comes crashing that at them, hitting them with an axe, the power of the hit extending through the landscape, splitting mountains, the weather, and creating lightning strikes in the sky.\n\n[[Clan::Ōtsutsuki Clan| ]]"
