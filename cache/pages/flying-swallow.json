A dense blade of chakra is formed around the physical blade, extending its reach. Because users can adjust the length of this chakra blade at will, opponents can never fully anticipate the user's attacks.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n[[Asuma]] performs the Flying Swallow with his unique [[Chakra Blades]]. He furthermore prefers using [[wind]] chakra so that his blades become sharp enough to cut through stone or metal.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 317, pages 13-17</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Flying Swallow is a piece used in ''[[Wikipedia:Taikyoku shogi|taikyoku shōgi]]'', a variant of the standard shōgi with over 400 pieces.\n* In the anime, Naruto was taught the basics of this technique to aid him in developing the [[Wind Release: Rasengan]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 63</ref>\n* Although ''[[Tō no Sho]]'' classifies Flying Swallow as taijutsu, its actual entry describes it as ninjutsu.\n* In the [[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja (series)|''Naruto: Ultimate Ninja'' series]], [[Kakashi]]'s midair taijutsu attacks are named \"Flying Swallow\", \"Rising Swallow\", and \"Falling Swallow\". When Asuma became playable in ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3]]'', the Japanese version of the game used \"Flying Swallow\" in both Kakashi's and Asuma's movesets. However, across both Kakashi and Asuma in the English translations of the games, their respective moves often go back and forth between called \"Flying Sparrow\" to avoid confusion.\n** Even in later games such as the first ''Storm'' game, Kakashi still keeps his swallow-naming-motif for some of his normal combos.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Samurai Sabre Technique]]''\n* [[Vacuum Sword]]\n* [[Wind Release: Vacuum Blade]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Golondrinas Voladoras]]\n[[fr:Hirondelle Volante]]\n[[pl:Hien]]\n[[pt-br:Voo da Andorinha]]\n[[ru:Летящая Ласточка]]"
