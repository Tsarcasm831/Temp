As they move towards their target, the attackers usually leap through the air in a formation reminiscent of the [[wikipedia:Lunar phase|crescent moon]], hence the name. Because all three attacks are meant to simultaneously come from a blindspot, targets can't reasonably defend against all of them. Moreover, because of the power behind the strikes, if even one of them lands successfully, the target is likely to be fatally wounded.<ref name=\"d1\"/> In the anime, landing all three attacks is powerful enough to send targets flying through several buildings.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 292</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The full name of this technique is {{translation|Leaf-Style Dance of the Crescent Moon|木ノ葉流三日月の舞|Konoha-Ryū Mikazuki no Mai|lit meaning=Tree Leaf-Style Dance of the Three Days' Moon}}.\n* \"Mikazuki\" is the name of one of the [[wikipedia:Tenka-Goken|Tenka-Goken]], five Japanese swords that are of historical and cultural significance.\n* In the original anime, they were simply afterimages with no form to hide an attack coming from above; however, this was changed in ''Shippūden'' when the fight was revisited.<ref>''Naruto: Shipūdden'' episode 307</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Reverse Mist Beheading]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Danza de la Luna Creciente]]\n[[fr:Danse sous la Nouvelle Lune]]\n[[pl:Mikazuki no Mai]]\n[[pt-br:Dança da Lua Crescente]]"
