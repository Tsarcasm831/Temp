Using the shuriken to spread and set the wires around, they can position them as to bind their target, requiring only to trigger a change of position of the set wires, such as cutting one of them, causing the others to rearrange. If a shinobi is highly perceptive, such as a [[Sharingan]] user, it is possible to use one's own projectiles to change the course of the wired shuriken as the trap is set, making it so the one setting the trap is immobilised instead."
