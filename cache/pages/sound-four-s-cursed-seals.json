Their seals, however, are not as powerful as the [[Cursed Seal of Heaven|Heaven]] and [[Cursed Seal of Earth|Earth]] seals, although they have similar end results. \n\n== Usage ==\nLike all cursed seals, each of them forcefully draws the user's chakra while feeding back [[senjutsu]] chakra in return, giving each individual a unique transformation and attribute boost, and receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and their ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active. Jirobo stated that utilising the second stage of the Cursed Seal makes them ten times more powerful than before.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 114</ref> However, Sakon comments that after using their cursed seal's second level and coming out of it, they lose a lot of energy.\n\nLater, in Part II of the anime, it was revealed that [[Orochimaru]] enhanced the power of their cursed seals, giving them the ability to use the [[Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover]], a technique capable of trapping the souls of the user and the victim within an untraceable barrier, to fight with little to no interference. The technique however, would result in the user's death. In the cases of the Sound Four, who were [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]], they were able to survive the usage of this technique, though their souls returned to the [[Pure Land]] when the barrier was broken.\n\n== Forms ==\n=== Jirōbō ===\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" widths=\"230\" hideaddbutton=true>\nJirōbō's Curse Mark 1.png|Jirōbō's cursed seal; first level.\nJirōbō Cursed Seal Lv 2.png|Jirōbō's cursed seal; second level.\n</gallery>\n[[Jirōbō]]'s cursed seal is the only one not seen before it is activated. However, the pattern that spreads during its first state are like chains of triangular arrows. When the second level of his seal is active, his skin turns maroon, his hair grows longer, and he also grows warts on his forehead and shoulders. He most greatly resembles an ogre in this form. He claims his strength increases ten times, to the point where he can single-handedly lift a [[Super Multi-Size Technique|gigantic]] [[Chōji Akimichi]].\n{{-}}\n\n=== Kidōmaru ===\n[[File:Cursed Seal Kidōmaru (Anime).svg|thumb|150px|left|Kidōmaru's cursed seal.]]\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" widths=\"230\" hideaddbutton=true>\nKidomaru Curse Mark.png|Kidomaru's cursed seal; first level.\nKidomaru Cusre Mark 2.png|Kidomaru's cursed seal; second level.\n</gallery>\n[[Kidōmaru]]'s cursed seal, seen only in the anime, is formed like a hook (placed with the sharp end down) with two tags at the end of the upper part. When the second level of his seal is active, his skin turns deep red, his hair grows longer and turns a light greyish colour, and he grows horns on his forehead and his elbows. He becomes more spider-like, almost oni-like in appearance in this form. By opening the third eye on his forehead, his accuracy increases to the point of pinpointing [[Neji Hyūga]]’s [[Byakugan]] blind spot from a distance of over 50 metres. This increase in strength and precision allowed him to use the destructive archery technique, [[Spider War Bow: Terrible Split]].\n{{-}}\n\n=== Tayuya ===\n[[File:Cursed Seal Tayuya.svg|thumb|left|150px|Tayuya's cursed seal.]]\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" widths=\"230\" hideaddbutton=true>\nTayuya Curse Mark 1.png|Tayuya's cursed seal; first level.\nTayuya Curse Mark 2.png|Tayuya's cursed seal; second level.\n</gallery>\n[[Tayuya]]'s cursed seal consists of three hooks, similar to a [[Wikipedia:Triskelion|triskelion]] on the back of her neck. When the second level of her seal is active, her hair grows longer, she grows five oddly-placed horns on her head, slightly resembling a crown, and her skin turns dark brown. The horns grow when she exerts herself. Her strength increases, to the point of breaking free of the [[Shadow Imitation Technique]].<ref>[https://naruto-official.com/en/news/01_1910 Shikamaru's Birthday Column]</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n=== Sakon and Ukon ===\n[[File:Cursed Seal Sakon & Ukon.svg|150px|left|thumb|Sakon and Ukon's cursed seal.]]\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" widths=\"230\" hideaddbutton=true>\nSakon and Ukon Curse Mark 1.png|Sakon and Ukons' cursed seal; first level.\nSakon and Ukon Curse Mark 2.png|Sakon and Ukons' cursed seal; second level.\n</gallery>\n[[Sakon and Ukon]] both have the same type of cursed seal, which consists of three circular dots placed like a triangular shape on their foreheads. When the second level of their seals are active, they resemble goblins with red skin, longer hair, a single horn (on opposite sides for each brother), and can grow black armour from their bodies (from the side where they separate). They can also extend their [[Sakon and Ukon's Kekkei Genkai|fusing abilities]] to someone other than each other, and [[Parasite Demon Demolition Technique|tear their opponents apart on a cellular level]].\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Marques Maudites du Quartet du Son]]\n[[pl:Przeklęte Pieczęcie Czwórki Dźwięku]]"
