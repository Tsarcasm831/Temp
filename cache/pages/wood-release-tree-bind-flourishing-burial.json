This technique is relatively powerful and holds opponents much more gracefully, with less of a strain on the user, because the user sinks them into the ground. Afterwards, the user can enclose the opponent so that their body is crushed.\n\nThis technique requires some preparation as Yamato first had to crush the earth and then add water before this technique could be used.\n\n== Trivia == \n* In the ''[[Naruto Collectible Card Game]]'', [[Yamato]]'s wooden restraints used in his version of the [[Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands]] is credited as this technique.\n\n[[pl:Mokuton: Jubaku Eisō]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Madeira: Enterro Glorioso pela Contenção na Árvore]]"
