The properties of this substance mean that it can both absorb and dissipate the force behind a blow when struck, resulting in it either deforming or bouncing upon impact.\n\nA skilled user of this technique, such as [[Dodai]], is capable of making it appear as if they were intending to protect an object or individual within the sphere, when in fact they merely use the ball as a distraction in order to occupy an enemy, while instead covertly [[Lava Release: Rubber Rope|withdrawing]] the item in question from the ball during its formation.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 555, pages 5-6</ref>\n\n[[Karyū]]'s rubber balls, dubbed {{translation|\"Lava Release: Rubber Spheres\"|熔遁・護謨鞠|Yōton: Gomumari}}, are darker in colour and far more solid. Used offensively for ranged attacks, Karyū's spheres can vary in size, from being hand held to rivalling the size of a house. As projectiles, he can control them remotely and they continuously gain momentum when bouncing off surfaces.<ref>''Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise,'' Chapter 1</ref> The damage each sphere can deal is proportionate to the amount of chakra put into the orbs.<ref>''Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise''</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the game, [[Dodai]] uses the ball not for defense, but for attack in two variations. In the first case, he places a small ball in front of him and then kicks it forcefully towards the opponent, causing the ball to act as a projectile and hit the opponent multiple times, ricocheting off walls. In the second case, he enters a much larger ball and jumps inside it, crushing the opponent from above with the weight of the ball.\n** In his victory pose, Dodai is also able to spin small balls around his palm, just as [[Karyū]] did.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Lava: Bola de Goma]]\n[[fr:Yôton - Boule de Caoutchouc]]\n[[pl:Yōton: Gomudama]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Fusão: Bola de Borracha]]"
