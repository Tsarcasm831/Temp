Due to the sudden lack of any available foothold, the target inevitably descends ever deeper into the depths of the chasm. As the target falls, Konan guides the explosive tags to stick to their body and detonate, with six hundred billion being enough for ten minutes of consecutive explosions — more than enough to counter the five minute time limit on [[Obito Uchiha]]'s [[Kamui|intangibility]].<ref name=\"Ch510\">''Naruto'' chapter 510, pages 1-4</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Japanese word for {{translation|''paper person''|紙者|shisha}} is pronounced the same as the Japanese word for {{translation|''messenger''|使者|shisha}}. This gives the name of this technique the additional meaning ''Messenger of God'' — a messenger of God being an angel, which is also Konan's moniker.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Fire Release: Exploding Flame Formation]]\n* [[Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Technique du Livre de Dieu]]\n[[pl:Kami no Shisha no Jutsu]]\n[[uk:Паперова Людина Бога]]"
