It can be used to quickly withdraw an ally from the attack line, being more efficient when combined with a [[Lava Release: Rubber Ball|distraction]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although it is unnamed in the anime and manga, the technique was named in the game.\n* In this game, Dodai also uses this technique for attacks in two variations. In the first case, he swings a double rope with force like a whip, striking the opponent with lashings that are so strong that they split the ground under his feet. In the second case, he forms a large number of ropes into a semblance of a hand and, having grabbed the opponent with it, lifts him into the air and after crushing him on the ground.\n\n[[es:Elemento Lava: Cuerda de Goma]]\n[[fr:Yôton - Corde Élastique]]\n[[pl:Uwolnienie Lawy: Gumowa Lina]]"
