Each \"foot\" creates a cannon of pressurised air bearing the appearance of an [[wikipedia:Elephant|elephant]]'s leg, causing devastating damage to the opponent. The first punch alone was capable of tunnelling a massive and deep hole in the ground, and the final punch proved strong enough to shatter a [[Truth-Seeking Ball]] defence.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 669, pages 15-16</ref> The strength of several of these punches was enough to temporarily immobilise [[Madara Uchiha]] as the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 669, page 14</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Daytime Tiger]]\n* [[Leaf Dragon God]]\n* [[Morning Peacock]]\n* [[Night Guy]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elefante del Ocaso]]\n[[fr:Éléphant du Soir]]\n[[pl:Sekizō]]\n[[pt-br:Elefante do Anoitecer]]"
