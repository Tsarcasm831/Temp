The user then uses their [[chakra]] to both control the body's movements and to hide all signs of the surgery, creating the appearance that the body is a live person. [[Kabuto Yakushi]] takes the extra step of erasing the body's odour so that others won't notice its smell. Kabuto likes to use the corpses he controls as body doubles, altering their faces with plastic surgery so that they look like him; Kabuto himself stays nearby, silencing his heartbeat so that he passes as a corpse.<ref name=\"d1\"/> Kabuto is only ever shown controlling one corpse at a time, which becomes inert once he moves far enough away.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 89</ref>\n\nIn the anime, reanimated corpses are shown to still possess the same abilities as when they were alive.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 111</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Control de Muertos]]\n[[fr:Technique de l'Âme Morte]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica da Alma Morta]]"
