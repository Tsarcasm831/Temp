The principle of this taijutsu is to rapidly increase the body's abilities by opening up to and including the sixth of the [[Eight Gates]], and then to strike the enemy down with countless punches.\n\n== Usage ==\nThe technique is started by kicking the enemy into the air, which for most would be an instant kill. The user then jumps into the air in a  distinctive stance and begins punching the enemy repeatedly. The punches are so fast, they are set ablaze by sheer speed and friction which in turn creates a peacock-like fan of flames around the opponent. Once the attack is finished, the enemy will be sent crashing back to the ground, covered with the attack's aura. The fire produced is strong enough to burn through [[Saiken]]'s [[Wisdom Wolf Decay]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 568, page 5</ref> and evaporates [[Water Release: A Thousand Feeding Sharks|hundreds of water sharks]].<ref name=\"c506\">''Naruto'' chapter 506, pages 12-14</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles]]'', [[Rock Lee]] used his version of this move called {{translation|[[w:c:springtimeofyouth:Morning Gorilla|Morning Gorilla]]|朝ゴリラ|Asa Gorira}}. In the anime, Lee used his different version of this move called {{translation|[[w:c:springtimeofyouth:Morning Chicken|Morning Chicken]]|朝鶏|Asa Niwatori}}.\n* This move can also be performed without the initial kick.\n* Should the opponent be out of range or too vast in numbers, it may also be used from a distance.\n* While listed only as a short-range punch in the Sha no Sho, the flames produced can spread to a longer distance.<ref name=\"c506\"/>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Daytime Tiger]]\n* [[Evening Elephant]]\n* [[Night Guy]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Amanecer del Pavo Real]]\n[[fr:Paon Matinal]]\n[[pl:Asakujaku]]\n[[pt-br:Pavão do Amanhecer]]\n[[ru:Утренний павлин]]"
