While they are still in the air, he creates a shadow clone which teleports repeatedly to the Flying Thunder God kunai around the opponent, constantly slashing them. Minato then goes into Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, charging a Rasengan. The shadow clone catches the opponent and teleports them directly in front of Minato, who lands his Rasengan, sending the opponent a long way before the Rasengan expands."
