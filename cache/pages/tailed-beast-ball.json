Gyūki is even shown doing something in between, not consuming its Tailed Beast Ball yet still firing it out in a wave.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 414, pages 6-9</ref> There is no limit to how much chakra can be put into a Tailed Beast Ball so long as the 8:2 ratio is maintained: [[Kurama]] has shown to be able to create a Tailed Beast Ball many times bigger than itself when using even a fraction of its chakra. <ref>''Naruto'' chapter 499, page 13</ref> Tailed Beasts can also combine their Tailed Beast Balls to form it into a very large one.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 571, pages 11-12</ref>\n\nTailed Beast Balls are incredibly dense, so much so that despite being suspended in the air, they instantly crater the ground beneath the user due to their extreme weight.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 295, page 2</ref><ref>''Naruto'', chapter 571, page 12</ref>  Despite how heavy they are, they move at an incredible rate once fired. When used by the Ten-Tails, the Tailed Beast Ball was able to cross several miles in only a few seconds.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 613, pages 11-15</ref> Tailed Beast Balls are very destructive, creating explosions that are visible from incredibly far away and that vaporize almost everything in the blast area.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 613, pages 8-12</ref> The extent of the damage is dependent upon how the ball is fired and how much chakra it has. Its \"standard\" size is enough to easily vaporize mountains.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 571, page 3</ref> The power of the Tailed Beast Ball is shown to even dwarf islands, however, Kurama and Gyūki have been shown to cause immense damage, such that the devastation dwarfed entire mountain ranges and could be felt across the continent. Tailed Beast Balls are comparatively weaker if a jinchūriki uses one without entering their [[Tailed Beast Mode]], yet it is still potent enough to represent a serious threat to people and infrastructure.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 438, pages 7-9</ref>\n\nSome jinchūriki are shown using Tailed Beast Balls in atypical ways. As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, [[Obito Uchiha]] is able to form multiple Tailed Beast Balls at once via a tree he creates, each of which can fire in a different direction.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 643, page 7</ref> Naruto, when using his [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode]], can form a Tailed Beast Ball with his hands, similar to how he makes the [[Rasengan]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 598, page 10</ref> He can also add [[natural energy]] to his Tailed Beast Balls, increasing their power and potency,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 695, page 13</ref> while also allowing them to be used against [[Truth-Seeking Ball]]s.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 645, page 12</ref> In the anime, [[Sora]] uses an entirely white Tailed Beast Ball while [[Version 2|transformed]] under the influence of the [[Nine-Tails]]' chakra.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 71</ref> [[Himawari Uzumaki]] is able to form a Tailed Beast Ball incredibly quickly from her mouth and hair which act like tails, making her resemble a miniature Kurama in her usage.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 11, pages 14-15</ref>\n\nBeing incarnations of the [[Ten-Tails (Kara)|Ten-Tails]], the sentient [[God Tree]]s have been shown to have the capability of using the Tailed Beast Ball. Unlike the tailed beasts and jinchūriki, [[Jura]] formed a Tailed Beast Ball from his right [[Rinnegan]].<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 9, page 32</ref>\n\n== Firing Methods ==\n<gallery columns=\"2\" widths=\"200\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nBijudama.png|Fired as a ball.\nNaruto vs. Kurama.png|Fired as a beam.\nGyuki's Bijudama.png|Fired as a wave.\nJura's Tailed Beast Ball.png|Fired from an eye.\nHimawari's Tailed Beast Ball.png|Fired from hair.\n</gallery>\n\n== Video Games Variations ==\n* In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 2]]'', [[Gaara]] is able to form [[Shukaku]]'s head out of [[sand]] and through it create a Tailed Beast Ball.\n* In ''Ultimate Ninja Storm 2'', Gyūki performs a [[Lightning Release]] [[Lightning (jutsu)|version]] of this technique.\n* In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'', [[Saiken]] performs a [[Freight Bundle Bubble|variation]] of this technique utilising [[Utakata]]'s [[Soap Bubble Ninjutsu]].\n* In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', Naruto and Sasuke perform a variation of this technique wherein the Tailed Beast Ball is coated with Sasuke's [[Amaterasu]] and the [[Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken|Tailed Beasts' specific chakra types]] are added to the ball. This was used against [[Madara Uchiha]]'s gigantic [[Chibaku Tensei]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Minato Namikaze]] based the [[Rasengan]] off of the Tailed Beast Ball. [[Killer B]] observes that the process for forming a Rasengan is exactly the same as forming a Tailed Beast Ball, with its [[Chakra#Chakra Control|chakra rotation]] acting as a substitute for the tailed beast form.<ref name=\"ch519\" />\n* In the manga, the Tailed Beast Ball is formed from positive black chakra and negative white chakra, and the completed ball is black.<ref>[[The Great War Breaks Out! (volume)|Volume 55]] cover</ref> In the anime, it is formed from positive blue chakra and negative red chakra, and the completed ball is purple.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 264</ref> In some instances, it is depicted taking on a red colour upon being fired.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 329</ref>\n** In ''[[J-Stars Victory VS]]'', Naruto's Tailed Beast Ball uses the manga's colour scheme, but glows yellow upon being fired.\n* Shukaku is the only tailed beast not seen using a Tailed Beast Ball in the manga. However, it does so in an anime-only dream world created by the [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]].<ref name=\"ep430\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 430</ref>\n* In ''Ultimate Ninja Storm 2'', [[Orochimaru]] is capable of using a similar attack when using his [[Eight Branches Technique]].\n* In the anime, one of the Infinite Tsukuyomi's dream worlds depicts the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]] using this technique.<ref name=\"ep430\" />\n* In ''[[Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze]]'', [[Kido Tsumiki]] has access to the Tailed Beast Ball via the usage of his [[Tailed Beast Drug]]. However, while powerful, his Tailed Beast Ball is noted to be nowhere near as powerful as ones coming from a true Tailed Beast.{{Citation needed}}\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Giant Sphere]]''\n* [[Tailed Beast Rasengan]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Bijuu Dama]]\n[[id:Bola Monster Berekor]]\n[[pl:Bijūdama]]\n[[pt-br:Bomba Bijuu]]\n[[fr:Orbe des Démons à Queues]]\n[[tr:Kuyruklu Canavar Topu]]"
