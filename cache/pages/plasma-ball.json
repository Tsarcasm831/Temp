The shield can be used offensively, by discharging the electricity in the direction of her choice in a wave.\n\nWhile Ranke is in her [[Gelel Beast Mode|transformed state]], the Plasma Ball is strong enough to defend her from something as wide-ranged as the [[Quicksand Waterfall Flow]], and she can rush at her opponents even if the barrier is active. However, if her electricity is drained, she cannot form the barrier and will be left vulnerable.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although the Japanese subtitle of this technique is written in kanji, it is pronounced in English, {{Translation|\"Plasma Ball\"|プラズマボール|Purazuma Bōru}}. The Japanese pronunciation of the kanji would be ''Kaden Shōhekikaku'', which would literally translate to \"Electric Charge Barrier Shell\".\n\n[[es:Bola de Plasma]]\n[[pl:Purazuma Bōru]]"
