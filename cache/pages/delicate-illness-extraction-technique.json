The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a [[chakra scalpel]], an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the [[medical-nin]] pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\n\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched [[chakra control]]. Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, [[Sarada Uchiha]], [[Inojin Yamanaka]], [[Wasabi Izuno]], [[Dōshu Goetsu]], [[Hako Kuroi]], and [[Iwabee Yuino]] were each taught the basics of this Antidote [[Jutsu]].<ref>''Boruto'' episode 152</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:La Aprendiz de Ninja Médico]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Extração Delicada de Doença]]\n[[fr:Technique d'Extraction du Poison]]\n[[pl:Saikan Chūshutsu no Jutsu]]"
