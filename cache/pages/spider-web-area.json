Kidōmaru constantly sends his [[chakra]] along the threads, allowing him to [[sense]] anything that comes into contact with them; the threads are sensitive enough to even detect slight disturbances in the air. Because the threads appear no different than normal spiderwebs, they aren't likely to be noticed and thus are effective as an alert of approaching enemies.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Kidōmaru uses this technique while he and the rest of the [[Sound Four]] are resting, ensuring they won't be ambushed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 185</ref> The touch threads, being stronger than wire, can also be used to reel in those who've contacted them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 186</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Area Scanning Technique]]''\n* [[Concealed Sand Picture Cat]]\n* [[Rain Tiger at Will Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Zone de Fils d'Araignée]]\n[[pt-br:Área da Teia de Aranha]]\n[[pl:Kumo Sōkei]]"
