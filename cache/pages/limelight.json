They will then join their lightning-[[chakra]] in the form of four connecting streams that shoot high into the sky above the target area. It will then create a massive ball of lightning powerful enough to incinerate everything within the area of the four users. It is considered to be the most powerful and destructive [[Lightning Release]] technique. While walking towards their designated positions, the users will generate fluctuating pillars of electricity from their bodies.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 66</ref> \n\nAs the technique requires all four users to be in position, if even one of them is disabled, then Limelight cannot activate at all.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The technique's name is a pun, similar to certain techniques of [[Kumogakure]]-ninja, in which it has an English name with a given kanji that somewhat matches the pronunciation.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Luz de Calcio]]\n[[fr:Limelight]]\n[[pl:Raimu Raito]]"
