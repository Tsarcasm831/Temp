He then arcs back down and dives toward his opponent at high speed while forming a [[Rasengan]] in his right palm, striking them with it at the moment of impact. His glittering blue chakra causes the attack to resemble a falling star.\n\n==Trivia==\n* This jutsu originally appeared without a name in the ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' anime in an extended piece of fight choreography created to heighten the final clash between Momoshiki and [[Kawaki]]; in the original manga, Momoshiki merely springs off the ground and flies straight at Kawaki while preparing his Rasengan.\n* The attack was later adapted into a distinct, named jutsu in ''[[Naruto Mobile]]'', with Momoshiki diving straight down to strike his foe.\n\n[[pl:Insei Rasengan]]"
