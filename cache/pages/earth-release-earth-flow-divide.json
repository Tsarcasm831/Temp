The length, width, direction, and curve of the chasm are shaped and fashioned by the user. Manipulating the Dragon Veins requires fine chakra control, but if one has such skill, they can use this technique to divide the space between the enemy and their own team in two, destroy enemy camps or defences, and even to attack.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Dragon Veins are a concept from [[Wikipedia:Feng shui|Feng Shui]]. They are energy flows running underground, usually along mountain ranges, and are similar to the Western concept of [[Wikipedia:Ley line|Ley lines]].\n* [[Source of the Ryūmyaku|Dragon Veins]] are mentioned as an ancient source of chakra in ''[[Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower]]''.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: División Divina de la Tierra]]\n[[fr:Doton - Fracture Tectonique]]\n[[pl:Doton: Doryūkatsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Terra: Divisão do Fluxo de Terra]]"
