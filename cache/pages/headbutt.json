According to [[Sabu]], this attack is strong enough to decapitate someone.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* As with many of the techniques of [[Kumogakure]] ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as ''Atama Hattō''.\n* Like Killer B's [[Lightning Release: Lariat]], this technique is also called Killer B's ''eighth sword''. Both techniques involve Killer B using the [[Gyūki|Eight-Tails]]' chakra to form horns.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Cabezazo]]\n[[fr:Coup de Tête]]\n[[pl:Heddo Batto]]"
