Using the \"power of reincarnation\" possessed by the White Snake as an intermediary, he can transform into a giant white serpent with eight heads and eight tails. The serpent boasts a giant body, even larger than that of [[Manda]], who was feared as the \"strongest colossal serpent\". Just by crawling on the scales of its abdomen it was able to trample the [[Uchiha hideout]], and could destroy most things without difficulty. This technique transcends the \"Snake\", and becomes like a \"Dragon God\".<ref name=\"d3\"/>\n\nWhen using this technique, Orochimaru can emerge from the mouth of one of the heads and use his [[Sword of Kusanagi (Orochimaru)|Sword of Kusanagi]] to attack.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name of this technique comes from the legendary snake [[Wikipedia:Yamata no Orochi|Yamata no Orochi]], a  monstrous eight-headed and eight-tailed snake that was destroyed by the god [[Wikipedia:Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susanoo-no-Mikoto]]. This is referenced when [[Itachi]]'s [[Susanoo]] killed the serpents produced by this technique.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2]]'', the eight snakes' heads can unite to create a devastating energy attack similar to a [[Tailed Beast Ball]] from a [[tailed beast]] that was powerful enough to overwhelm the defences of Itachi's armoured [[Susanoo]], even with it using its [[Yata Mirror]] for defence.\n* Despite the fact that this technique was stated to be the product of Orochimaru's years of human experimentation and the [[Living Corpse Reincarnation]] technique in the manga,<ref name=\"d3\"/> in the anime, it was stated that Orochimaru, upon defecting from [[Konohagakure]], stole the [[scroll]] from the [[Hokage Residence]] with the information on this [[kinjutsu]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 114</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Yamata]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Yamata]]\n[[ru:Техника Восьми Ветвей]]"
