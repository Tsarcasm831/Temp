By exposing their special body fluids to [[natural energy]], they gain increased physical capabilities and the ability to perform various shape-shifting feats.\n\n== Usage ==\nThis transformation is a multifaceted ability that permits them to achieve feats ranging from creating various weapon-like appendages to even consuming other human beings, as well as a general increase in their physical capabilities, such as in strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception and durability, along with improved power of techniques. Once transformed, common features include eyes with yellow irides and black sclerae, altered skin colour and longer hair (hair colour change may also occur in some users).\n\n== Variants ==\n* In the experiments created by [[Orochimaru]], this ability is referred to as {{translation|\"''[[Orochimaru's Juinjutsu#Transformations|Cursed Seal Transformation]]|engtv=Curse Mark Transformation''\"|呪印化|Juinka}}.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 593, page 5</ref> A user of the Sage Transformation can transplant their flesh with anyone compatible with such experiments, in the events of a heavy injury, though this will cause the user's body to shrink in size and age.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 413, page 15</ref>\n* [[Kabuto]], having assimilated Jūgo's DNA, uses this transformation to enter Sage Mode.\n* Initially [[Mitsuki]] could only access this ability to enter Sage Mode subconsciously.<ref name=\"Mitsuki Gaiden\">''Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon''</ref> Later in the anime, it was shown that he could do so freely.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 58</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Tosaka]] \"perfected\" his [[Cursed Seal Device]] by attaining a sample of Jūgo's genetic material, granting him an inferior version of Sage Transformation.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 103</ref>\n<gallery columns=\"2\" widths=\"200\" captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nJūgo's Sage Transformation.png|Jūgo's Sage Mode.\nKabuto's Sage Transformation.png|Kabuto's Sage Mode.\nMitsuki's ST anime.png|Mitsuki's Sage Mode.\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The term {{translation|\"Sage Transformation\"|仙人化|Senninka}} can also refer to the transformation into the [[jinchūriki]] of the [[Ten-Tails]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 666, page 6</ref>\n* While Orochimaru discovered the [[Ryūchi Cave]] and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, he was not able to use Sage Transformation to enter Sage Mode, since he lacked a compatible body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 579</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Orochimaru's Juinjutsu]]\n* [[Reverse Scale]]\n* [[Six Paths Senjutsu]]\n* [[Six Paths Sage Mode]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Clan::Jūgo's clan| ]]\n\n[[es:Transformación del Sabio]]\n[[fr:Transformation Ermite]]\n[[pl:Senninka]]\n[[pt-br:Transformação Sábia]]"
