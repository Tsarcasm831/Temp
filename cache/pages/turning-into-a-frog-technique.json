This is mainly used for  interrogating several prisoners of war. Seeing their comrades changed into a frog before their eyes, the prisoners of war will cave in, becoming what could be described as a \"frog chorus\", sonorously chanting information. This terrifying technique will, without a doubt, make an \"information leak\" open up. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* The word for frog, \"蛙\", is pronounced \"kaeru\". The term \"to turn into\", written as \"変える\", is also pronounced \"kaeru\", which leads to this technique's interesting pronunciation, \"Kaeru Kaeru no Jutsu\".\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Transformation Batracienne]]\n[[pl:Kaeru Kaeru no Jutsu]]"
