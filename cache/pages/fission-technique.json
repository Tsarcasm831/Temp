This also means that even if one is incapacitated, the other remains completely unaffected as neither can truly be regarded as the original. \n\nBecause the duplicates cannot be dispelled like normal clones, they will be unable to reunite if one is sealed. This poses a great risk to Mū as his chakra reserves are also halved in the process. In doing so, he is left unable to use more taxing techniques like his [[Dust Release]] [[kekkei tōta]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 558, page 6</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 560, page 7</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Slug Great Division]]\n* ''[[Ten-Tails Fission]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Bunretsu no Jutsu]]\n[[fr:Technique de Division]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Divisão]]\n[[pl:Bunretsu no Jutsu]]"
