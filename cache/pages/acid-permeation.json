The sheer multitude and wide-range it can cover makes avoiding it very difficult.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Santōka is the given name of {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Santōka Taneda|Santōka Taneda]]|種田山頭火|Taneda Santōka}}. He was a [[wikipedia:haiku|haiku]] poet, well-known for his free style haiku lacking the traditional 5-7-5 syllabic rule and seasonal word. He is called a wandering poet for the many trips he took in his later life as a Buddhist monk, wandering through Japan without being part of a monastery.\n* The ''san'' in Santōka's name is actually written with the kanji for {{translation|''mountain''|山}}, but for this technique, it is interpreted as {{translation|''acid''|酸}}, also pronounced ''san''. ''Tōka'' is interpreted as meaning {{translation|''permeation''|透過}} instead of {{translation|''head''|頭}} and {{translation|''fire''|火}}, which it means in Santōka's name.\n* Although he wasn't shown using this technique in the manga, it was stated he could mix acid in with his bubble ninjutsu.<ref name=\"d4\">Fourth Databook, page 37</ref> This is also demonstrated in ''[[Naruto Mobile]]''.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Ácido Penetrante]]\n[[pl:Santōka]]"
