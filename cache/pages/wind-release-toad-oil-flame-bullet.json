It is an expansion of the [[Wind Release: Toad Oil Bullet]] technique. After Naruto enhances Gamatatsu's [[Toad Oil Bullet]] with his wind-natured chakra, Gamakichi steps in and uses his [[Fire Release: Flame Bullet]] technique to ignite the oil. The wind not only improves the oil's coverage and distance, but also adds power to the flame. Using this technique they were able to knock out the [[Three-Tails]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet]]\n* [[Sage Art: Goemon]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Vento: Projétil de Chamas do Óleo de Sapo]]\n[[pl:Fūton: Gamayu Endan]]\n[[ru:Стихия Ветра: Пламенный Выстрел Жабьего Масла]]"
