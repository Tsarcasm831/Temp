Understanding this theory, the Body Revival Technique can repair the user's body and increase its strength by manipulating the \"Destruction and Rebirth\" cycle of the muscles.\n\nThis technique allows the user to survive any otherwise normally fatal damage and instantly heal from the damage. A unique trait of this technique is that it can momentarily give the user the appearance of death, fooling even the most talented [[medical-nin]]s.\n\nWhen combined with [[Zero-Tails|Dark Chakra]], this technique can also be used to physically enhance the person's speed, strength and healing capabilities to superhuman levels. It also alters the person's physical appearance drastically, making them younger and more fit in looks, greatly bulking their muscular physique. By Shinnō's claim, this form allows him to perform techniques that are normally taxing for the body, including open all [[Eight Gates]], without any drawbacks. However, if the user loses proper control over the dark chakra while performing this technique, it can cause severe backlash that can destroy the body.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique's principles is fundamentally similar to [[Wikipedia:Biofeedback|biofeedback]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Creation Rebirth]]\n* [[Regeneration Ability]]\n* [[Ultra-Fast Regeneration Technique]]\n* [[Yin Healing Wound Destruction]]\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Cuerpo Reanimado]]\n[[fr:Résurrection Physique]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Renascimento do Corpo]]\n[[pl:Nikutai Kassei no Jutsu]]"
