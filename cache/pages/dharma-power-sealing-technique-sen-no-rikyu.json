The chains move very fast, able to bypass [[Gaara]]'s [[Shield of Sand]], which is known for its speed. Once latched on to the target's body and [[Chakra Pathway System|chakra network]], the chains will use the [[tenketsu]] located at the navel to reach their way to the [[tailed beast]] and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the [[jinchūriki]]. The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinchūriki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinchūriki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock. However, if another jinchūriki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.\n\nThe technique can be countered. Techniques that suppress [[Chakra Absorption Techniques|chakra absorption]] such as a [[cocoon]] made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by [[Gentle Fist: Tenketsu Needle|closing]] the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\n\nThere is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them. Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique is most likely named after a Japanese historical figure, known as [[wikipedia:Sen no Rikyū|Sen no Rikyū]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Adamantine Sealing Chains]]\n* [[Demonic Statue Chains]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dharma Power Sealing Technique: Sen no Rikyu}}\n\n[[fr:Pouvoir du Sceau Sacré - Sen no Rikyû]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Selamento do Poder Budista: Sen no Rikyū]]\n[[pl:Hōriki Fūinjutsu: Sen no Rikyū]]"
