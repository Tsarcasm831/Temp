This sensing sand can be spread across a wide terrain, or even float in the air allowing aerial foes to be detected.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 552, pages 16-17</ref> Once the sand comes in contact with a person, it will wrap itself around them, rendering even invisible targets, visible.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 524, page 16</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique's name might come from \"picturing a concealed sand cat\", as shown in its first usage, when Gaara used it to sense [[Mū]], who was under the effects of his [[Dustless Bewildering Cover|invisibility technique]]. [[wikipedia:Sand cat|Sand cats]] are capable of walking on sand without leaving noticeable footprints. When this technique was used on the Second Tsuchikage, the shot focused on his footprints, which were imprinted in the sand.\n* The [[wikipedia:Furigana|reading]] of {{translation|潜砂|sensa}} is the same as the Japanese word for {{translation|sensor|センサ|sensa}}.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Area Scanning Technique]]''\n* [[Rain Tiger at Will Technique]]\n* [[Spider Web Area]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Arena Sensitiva]]\n[[fr:Détection par le Sable]]\n[[pl:Sensa Kaibyō]]\n[[pt-br:Imagem do Gato Escondido na Areia]]"
