The insect's growth depends on how much [[chakra]] the host is using and a massive amount of chakra can speed up the growth process. The insect can however be removed by the means of surgery, though it is difficult, as one mistake could cause the insect to explode.\n\nThe [[Nokizaru Group]], notable users of this technique, regularly taunts their victims into attacking after being exposed, thereby accelerating the process.\n\n== See Also == \n* [[C4]]\n* [[Explosive Clay]]\n\n[[es:Insecto Explosivo]]\n[[pt-br:Inseto Explosivo]]"
