This technique, however, rapidly depletes the user's own chakra reserves, leaving them with a presumably permanent bite mark after each use. Due to the technique's accelerated depletion of chakra, it is dangerous for one to use this ability too regularly as Karin normally refrains from doing so more than once a day.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Due to inconsistencies within the anime and manga, it's unknown if Karin's bite marks are always present.\n* This ability is uniquely tied to the user’s chakra’s specific characteristics, not to a jutsu that can be willingly used.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Uzumaki clan| ]]\n\n[[es:Mordida de la Cura]]\n[[fr:Morsure de Soin]]\n[[pl:Tairyoku Kaifuku]]\n[[pt-br:Regeneração de Vigor]]"
