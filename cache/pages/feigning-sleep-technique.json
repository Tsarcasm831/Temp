This causes him to surrender control to [[Shukaku]], who is [[Jinchūriki|sealed]] within him. While it is the dominant personality, Shukaku has complete access to its large [[chakra]] reserves, which it uses according to its inherently destructive tendencies.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Before using this technique, Gaara creates a full replica of Shukaku out of [[sand]] for it to use.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 134</ref> Gaara emerges from the replica's forehead in order to perform this technique, where his body remains even after he's asleep. This represents a vulnerability, as opponents can focus their attacks on Gaara with the goal of rousing him.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 135</ref> If they do successfully wake Gaara, Shukaku's personality will be suppressed again.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 136</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique also translates to something akin to \"Tanuki Sleep Technique\", or in some dubs \"Playing Possum Jutsu\". This is a reference to Shukaku being a [[Wikipedia:Tanuki|tanuki]].\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'', [[Naruto]] uses a similar technique while in a pyjama costume, causing him to fall asleep while his health bar recovers.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Sueño Fingido]]\n[[fr:Sommeil du Tanuki]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Sono do Tanuki]]\n[[pl:Tanuki Neiri no Jutsu]]"
