The dragon that the user creates can vary in terms of appearance. While both instances created a serpentine dragon, [[Wikipedia:Chinese dragon|Chinese dragon]], though the first had a short trunk-like nose, while the other two later created did not. It also has the ability to [[Chakra Absorption Techniques|absorb]] chakra from its target, slowly rendering them unable to use techniques by biting into the target and draining them almost in a vampiric fashion.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 608, page 6</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 656, page 4</ref> In the anime, Hashirama was able to cause the dragon to detonate on his target, resulting in a large explosion.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 368</ref>\n\n== Countering ==\nDespite being a formidable technique, it was shown that if the wood dragon's head is destroyed, its ability to consume chakra is eliminated. Both [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Kurama]] countered it this way by destroying the head with a [[Body Flicker Technique]] and [[Tailed Beast Ball]] combination respectively.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 608, page 12</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 620, page 14</ref> [[Madara Uchiha]] would also counter it with his [[Susanoo]], deflecting its attempts to drain his chakra with a sword.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 641, page 2</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThe dragon created by this technique resembles a creature predominantly seen in Hindu mythology known as the [[Wikipedia:Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]]. Over time, the myth surrounding this creature has spread throughout most of Asia, and in Chinese renditions of the creature it most resembles this one: a dragon with an elephant's trunk.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, Hashirama's generic dragon is depicted the same as the trunk-like nosed dragon.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 388</ref>\n* Hashirama noted that the chakra absorption feature of this technique negates the [[Chakra Absorption Techniques]] of a bound target.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 656, page 2</ref>\n* When the [[Wood Release: Wood Human Technique]] was used, this dragon encircles the creature's torso.\n* In certain parts of Japanese mythology, dragons are considered deities with power over wood, forests, and water, likely a reference to Hashirama's Wood Release.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Madeira: Técnica do Dragão de Madeira]]\n[[pl:Mokuton: Mokuryū no Jutsu]]\n[[fr:Mokuton - Dragon Ligneux]]"
