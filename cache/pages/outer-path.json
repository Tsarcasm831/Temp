It grants the user the power to control life and death. With this power, the user is able to [[Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique|revive the dead]], transmit their [[chakra]] into [[black receiver]]s, and manifest [[Demonic Statue Chains|chakra chains]].<section end=summary />\n\n== Overview ==\nOne who wields the Rinnegan is said to exist outside the realm of life and death. They are regarded as the seventh [[Six Paths of Pain|Pain]], the Outer Path, and wield the power to control life and death itself. With this power, the user is able to revive the dead through the [[Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 449</ref> though doing so comes at the cost of the user's life.<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 251</ref>\n\nThe Rinnegan allows for the creation of black receivers,<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 255</ref> and by transmitting their chakra into these receivers, the user can bind anyone they touch through the power of the Outer Path. The user can also manifest the [[Demonic Statue Chains|chakra chains]] of the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]] to restrain those who touch the receivers with an even greater binding power.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 569, page 10</ref> By implanting black receivers into corpses or [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]] individuals, the user can reanimate and remotely control the bodies as the [[Six Paths of Pain]]. These bodies, as well as the [[King of Hell]] and the creatures [[Summoning Rinnegan|summoned]] through the [[Animal Path]], all have reflections of the Rinnegan in their eyes and share visual information with the user through the Outer Path.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 551, page 5</ref><ref name=\"ch565\">''Naruto'' chapter 565, pages 5-6</ref>\n\n[[File:Summoned Souls of Previous Kage.png|thumb|left|Souls summoned back from the Pure Land.]]\nDuring the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], [[Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki]] demonstrated the ability to recall the souls of the previous [[Kage]] from the [[Pure Land]] to assist him in [[Summoning Technique|summoning]] [[Team Kakashi|Team 7]] and the [[tailed beasts]] back from [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]]'s [[Kaguya's Dimensions|core dimension]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 690, pages 14-17</ref> When summoned in this manner, the deceased person does not have an actual body, but appears as a mass of flickering chakra in full possession of their personality and memories. Once the user ends the technique, the summoned souls dwindle and ultimately disappear completely. Hagoromo was also able to undo another person's use of the [[Impure World Reincarnation]] technique, releasing the reincarnated souls from their vessels and sending them to the Pure Land.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 691</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|''Gedō''|外道|lit meaning=Outer Path}}, derived from the Sanskrit ''[[Wikipedia:Tirthika|Tīrthika]]'', refers to any doctrine which \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the {{translation|''Naidō''|内道|lit meaning=Inner Path}}, and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\n* The Demonic Statue of the Outer Path may have some relation to this technique, as it shares the same name. [[Madara Uchiha]] is responsible for giving the statue its name.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 606, page 14</ref>\n* Some abilities of the Outer Path may only be available to those who are truly alive themselves, as Madara in his reincarnated state required another living Rinnegan wielder to revive him.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 614, pages 5-6</ref>\n* [[Naruto Uzumaki]] referred to the control of the Six Paths of Pain as an {{translation|''Outer Path Technique''|外道の術|Gedō no Jutsu|viz=Gedo Jutsu}}.<ref name=\"ch565\"/>\n* [[Kabuto Yakushi]] noted that he could force [[Nagato]] to remove a person's soul with the [[Human Path]], then store both their body and soul inside the King of Hell with the [[Naraka Path]] and revive them at a later time. However, it is unknown if this involves the Outer Path, as the process was interrupted.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 551, page 4</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Camino Externo]]\n[[fr:Gedô]]\n[[pl:Gedō]]\n[[pt-br:Caminho Exterior]]"
