During this technique, the falling raindrops are closely linked to Pain's senses. When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected. The detection of the rain, however, is not specific as Pain can only know if someone has entered the vicinity of the rain but not where specifically they are. Upon knowing an intruder has entered the rain's vicinity, he needs [[Konan|someone who specialises in covering large areas]] to find the intruder's specific location. The rain will keep on falling until Pain uses the seal to cancel it. When Pain is away from [[Amegakure]], he always uses this technique to keep a close eye on the village. He also made it rain every Sunday.\n\nAssuming that no one in the village knows about the sensory nature of this technique apart from Nagato and Konan, outsiders will think the rain is a natural occurrence and will not be aware they will be detected once the raindrops fall upon them.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The [[Wikipedia:tiger|tiger]] is well-known for its ferocity and watchfulness. It keeps a very close guard on its cubs, watches vigilantly for an opportunity to catch its prey, and walks great distances to patrol its territory; all a reference to how Pain uses this technique to vigilantly watch over the village.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Area Scanning Technique]]''\n* [[Concealed Sand Picture Cat]]\n* [[Spider Web Area]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Lluvia del Tigre]]\n[[fr:Détection par la Pluie]]\n[[pl:Ukojizai no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Tigre à Vontade na Chuva]]"
