In [[Sasuke Uchiha]]'s case, while Amaterasu is cast from his left eye, he uses his right eye to manipulate the flames.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 464, page 7</ref>\n\n== Variants ==\nThe user can shape the flames in different varieties, for both offence and defence.\n* While using the ribcage state of [[Susanoo]], the user can create a [[Amaterasu: Flame Wrapping Fire|defensive encampment]] by manipulating the flames to cover it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 463, page 16</ref>\n* Converging the flames in front of the user, a barrier of spike-shaped flames can be created that not only shields him, but also pierces and burns any opponent that touches it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 464, pages 1-2</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 682, page 15</ref>\n* The user can wield the flames in their hand without being incinerated,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 641, page 10</ref> as well as manipulate them into a flexible sword which launches spike-shaped projectiles when swung.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 632, page 17</ref>\n* The black flames can be used simultaneously with the [[Chidori]] to enhance the latter's destructive power.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 698, page 4</ref>\n* The user wraps it around their sword, increasing its potency.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 135</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nSimilar to other [[Mangekyō Sharingan]] abilities, Kagutsuchi's name is derived from Japanese myth and religion. [[Wikipedia:Kagu-tsuchi|Kagutsuchi]] is the God of Fire in [[Wikipedia:Shinto|Shinto]] and the one who brought death into the world by burning his mother, [[Wikipedia:Izanami|Izanami]], to death as she gave birth to him. This made his father, [[Wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]], kill him with the [[Wikipedia:Totsuka-no-Tsurugi|Sword of Totsuka]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Sasuke's Susanoo is capable of wielding an orb of black flames, from which he can produce various weapons. Although the sword formed in this manner was initially identified as \"Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi\",<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 585, page 7</ref> it was later named as part of a derivative technique called \"[[Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi]]\".<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 634, page 12-13</ref> In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'', it is named \"[[Sword of Kagutsuchi]]\".\n* In [[To Be Myself|chapter 585]], the [[Wikipedia:Furigana|furigana]] of this technique's name were written in [[Wikipedia:Hiragana|hiragana]], not in [[Wikipedia:Katakana|katakana]], as they're usually written.\n* According to the [[Jin no Sho|fourth databook]], Sasuke invented this technique when he fought [[A (Fourth Raikage)|A]],<ref name=\"d4\" /> but a [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[Tobirama Senju]] commented that he had seen it before during his lifetime.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 634, page 14</ref> The only people who are confirmed to have wielded the Mangekyō during his lifetime were [[Madara Uchiha]] and [[Izuna Uchiha]].\n** In the anime, Sasuke is able to put out the black flames of Amaterasu using Kagutsuchi. This resembles the manga, where he put the black flames out as well, although this happened before his alleged invention of the technique.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Infierno: Kagutsuchi]]\n[[id: Elemen Bara: Kagutsuchi]]\n[[fr:Enton - Auxiliaires de Feu Noir]]\n[[pl:Enton: Kagutsuchi]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Chama: Kagutsuchi]]"
