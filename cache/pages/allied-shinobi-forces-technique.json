Using [[Inoichi]]'s [[Mind Body Switch Technique|telepathic]] abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\n\nThe first step would executed by the [[Kumo]]-nin, who would use [[Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar]] to temporarily blind the opponents and [[Storm Release: Laser Circus]] to create a cloud of dust. Next, [[Suna]]-nin would use their [[Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance]] to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while [[Aburame clan]] members and [[Kiri]]-nin would use their [[Insect Jamming Technique]] and [[Hiding in Mist Technique]] to impair their sensory skills. \n\nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the [[Iwa]]-nin create a large sink hole with their [[Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core]], with their [[Lava Release|lava]] users covering the beast with [[Lava Release: Quicklime Congealing Technique|quicklime]], mixing it with the Kiri-nin's [[Water Release: Water Bullet Technique|water]]. [[Konoha]]'s [[Sarutobi clan]] would then [[Fire Release: Great Flame Technique|heat]] this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\n\nWith the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using [[taijutsu]], having coordinated with [[Naruto]] to exploit their weaknesses.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite the name, the Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is not a specific technique used by the army, but rather a collaboration of different techniques being used to achieve a single goal.\n* Despite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it.\n\n[[fr:Technique de l'Alliance Shinobi]]\n[[pl:Shinobi Rengōgun no Jutsu]]"
