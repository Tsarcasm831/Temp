Shouting {{translation|\"flow\"|流|ryū}}, he then dashes forward at such an extreme speed that the space ahead of the user is distorted, making it impossible for the target to defend against it. Guy then deals an immensely powerful kick which carries such force that it is capable of obliterating the target's body, as well as creating a devastating shock wave linear to the kick. The damage itself was so great that even [[Madara Uchiha]] as the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]] feared for his life.\n\nThe recoil was such that it completely shattered the bones in Guy's striking leg. As a result of opening the Eight Gates, the fatal repercussions of doing so soon left Guy on the brink of death; slowly turning into ash, crumbling from the immense discharge of his chakra.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The {{translation|\"flow\"|流|ryū}} could possibly be the reference to {{translation|\"Dragon\"|龍|ryū}} in Japanese.\n* While the other Eight Gates techniques combine a time of the day with an animal, this technique's name swaps the animal's name with Guy's own name, indicating that Guy became the dragon himself.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', this jutsu is used in conjunction with [[Evening Elephant]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Daytime Tiger]]\n* [[Evening Elephant]]\n* [[Leaf Dragon God]]\n* [[Morning Peacock]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Guy Nocturno]]\n[[fr:Gaï de la Nuit]]\n[[pt-br:Guy Noturno]]\n[[pl:Yagai]]"
