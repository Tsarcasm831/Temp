Despite these chains having been stated to being an incomplete version of the Adamantine Sealing Chains, Karin was able to use this technique to destroy most of [[Tobi (Zetsu)|Tobi]]'s [[Kanzeon Lotus King|giant wooden statue]] and its [[Top Transformed Buddha|many hands]].\n\nWhile said to be incomplete, in the anime, Karin later showed the ability to not only attack with the chains but neutralise her target by binding and nullifying their chakra with the chains.<ref name=\"eps408\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 408</ref> When used against [[Suigetsu Hōzuki]], it sent him flying some distance away, leaving him incapacitated and his [[Hydrification Technique|body]] in its jelly-like state.<ref name=\"eps408\"/> Karin also seems capable of manipulating the size of her chains to fit the situation.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While it was unnamed in the manga and anime, it was named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]''.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Beast Sealing Technique]]''\n* [[Demonic Statue Chains]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Technique de la Chaîne Dorée à Entrave Serrée]]\n[[id:Rantai Penyerang Adamantine]]\n[[pl:Kinbaku Kingusari no Jutsu]]"
