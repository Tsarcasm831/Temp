In exchange for getting to feed off of their host's chakra, the insects follow the host's every command: from attack to defence to reconnaissance, and everything in between. The insects inevitably become the core ability of the Aburame's entire fighting style, upon which all of their other [[jutsu]] rely.\n\nThis technique, alternatively translated as \"Kikaichū Technique\", is named after the [[kikaichū]], the species of insects that Aburame are most commonly colonised by. But they are not the only option: [[Torune]] uses [[rinkaichū]] and [[Yōji]] used [[kochū]]. Aburame are not even restricted to a single species: [[Shino]] uses both kikaichū and [[kidaichū]]; [[Muta]] uses kikaichū and [[shōkaichū]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Torune's rinkaichū version of this technique has been referred to as {{translation|\"Venomous Insect Technique\"|毒蟲の術|Dokumushi no Jutsu}} by [[Danzō]].<ref name=\"NS317\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 317</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Huésped de Insectos Destructivos]]\n[[fr:Technique d'Insecte Parasite Destructeur]]\n[[pl:Kikaichū no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Insetos Parasitas Destrutivos]]"
