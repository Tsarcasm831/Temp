This catches the attacking limb between their two limbs, and drives the elbow down with great force, effectively shattering the bone. Genshō used this technique while disguised as [[Yagura (anime)|Yagura]] to \"break\" [[Rock Lee]]'s [[Leaf Whirlwind]] by intercepting his attacking leg. Even though Lee's ankle was not broken due to protection from his ankle [[weights]], he was forced to completely halt his training until the injury was fully healed.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Ninja Art: Bare-Handed Blade Block]]\n\n[[es:Método de Intersección]]\n[[pl:Kōsahō]]"
