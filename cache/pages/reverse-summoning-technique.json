But whereas the regular Summoning Technique functions identically from one use to the next, the Reverse Summoning Technique has had two distinct uses seen in the series:\n* With the standard Summoning Technique, a [[shinobi]] summons an animal that they've signed a contract with to their location.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 92</ref> The Reverse Summoning Technique does the opposite, allowing an animal to summon a shinobi that has signed a contract with its species to its location.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 409</ref> Whereas summons performed by shinobi have some sort of time limit, after which the animal will automatically return to its home,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 642, page 8</ref> summons performed by animals have no known time limit, as [[Naruto Uzumaki]] remains at [[Mount Myōboku]] for several days after he's been reverse summoned there, and is not forcibly teleported back to Mount Myōboku when he is reverse summoned to [[Konohagakure]] during [[Pain's Assault (Arc)|Pain's Assault]]. Animals can return the shinobi to where they were summoned from when they choose,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 491</ref> potentially overlapping with the Reverse Summoning Technique's second form of usage.\n* After a shinobi has summoned an animal, they can use the Reverse Summoning Technique to transport the animal to another location. The shinobi and/or their allies can accompany the animal when this is done, such as by riding in its mouth, giving the shinobi a method of quickly traveling long distances<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 44</ref> or escaping confinement.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 48</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* During [[Pain's Assault]], [[Fukasaku]] uses a scroll that's been marked with the kanji for {{translation|\"human\"|人|hito}} when he reverse summons Naruto Uzumaki's [[shadow clone]]s.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 433</ref> The exact reason for using the scroll is unclear.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Invocación Inversa]]\n[[fr:Invocation Inversée]]\n[[pl:Gyaku Kuchiyose no Jutsu]]"
