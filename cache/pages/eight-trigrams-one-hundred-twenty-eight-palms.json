It is essentially a seventh step to the [[Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms]], doubling the previous barrage total and at twice the speed. To perform, the user crutches down while extending both arms outward, one in front and the other behind while angled like propeller blades. This adds another row of kanji to the envisioned Eight Trigrams symbol, extending the technique's perimeter. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through one hundred and twenty-eight [[chakra points]] of an opponent's [[Chakra Pathway System]]. This eliminates their ability to use [[chakra]] for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move. Alternatively, it can be used to hit a great number of targets very quickly.\n\nOnce someone is within range of the user's field of divination, they assume a Gentle Fist stance and begin to deliver the attack:\n* First, two consecutive strikes to make two.\n* Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.\n* Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.\n* Fourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.\n* Fifth, sixteen consecutive strikes to make thirty-two.\n* Sixth, thirty-two consecutive strikes to make sixty-four.\n* Seventh, sixty-four consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of one hundred and twenty-eight strikes.\n\n[[es:Ocho Trigramas Ciento Veintiocho Palmas]]\n[[pl:Hakke Hyaku Nijūhasshō]]\n[[pt-br:Oito Trigramas: Cento e Vinte e Oito Palmas]]\n[[ru:Хакке Хьяку Ниджухачи Шо]]"
