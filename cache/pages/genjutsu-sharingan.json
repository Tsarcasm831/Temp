It has also been shown to be performed through the Sharingan's higher evolutions: the [[Mangekyō Sharingan]] and the [[Rinnegan]].\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Kurama controlled by Rinnegan.png|thumb|left|The technique utilised through the Rinnegan.]]\nBy establishing eye contact with a target, the Sharingan user traps them within a genjutsu which can be exploited for one of various purposes, such as: causing instantaneous — but temporary — loss of consciousness or paralysis in the target,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 560, page 7</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 456, page 8</ref> forceful extraction of information,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 408, pages 3-5</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 510, page 16</ref> relaying memories,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 590, page 6</ref> erasing memories,<ref>''Boruto'' episode 136</ref> removing genjutsu placed on the target by others,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 585, pages 12</ref> and controlling a target's actions.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 540, page 14</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 589, page 8</ref> \n\nMembers of the [[Uchiha clan]] are particularly famous for using their Sharingan to control the [[Nine-Tails]], so much so that [[Konoha]] quickly came to suspect Uchiha involvement in the [[Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 501, pages 7-8</ref> [[Sasuke Uchiha]] is noted to be able to use the technique through his Rinnegan, to trap all the [[tailed beasts]] in a genjutsu with a mere glance.<ref name=\"chpt692\">''Naruto'' chapter 692</ref>\n\nThe illusions created by Genjutsu: Sharingan do not appear to have any trademark form, appearing vastly different between the same functions and even the same users. For example, Sasuke typically uses it to render targets unconscious, yet on the first occasion the target's body is pierced with large feathers,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 413, pages 8-9</ref> on another, the target is grasped and overwhelmed by a shadowy figure,<ref name=\"chpt462\">''Naruto'' chapter 462, pages 5-7</ref> and on the third the target experiences Sasuke personally stabbing them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 693, page 6-7</ref>\n\n== Trivia == \n* [[Sasuke]]<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 413, pages 7–8</ref> and [[Itachi]] Uchiha<ref name=\"NS376\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 376</ref><ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 455</ref> have both been shown activating their Mangekyō Sharingan to cast genjutsu despite already having their regular Sharingan activated, implying that this technique is enhanced in some way by the evolved dōjutsu, or that there is a similar technique utilised only by the Mangekyō Sharingan.\n* A shadowy version of Sasuke's humanoid [[Susanoo]] first appears in a genjutsu he creates,<ref name=\"chpt462\"/> only making a formal début several chapters later.\n* By making eye contact with a [[jinchūriki]], [[Obito]] could use this technique to control the tailed beast sealed inside them, while its host remained unaffected.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 501, pages 7–11</ref>\n* Despite genjutsu working by altering the chakra flow of a target's cerebral nervous system, this technique affected [[Mecha-Naruto]] who doesn't have a brain.<ref name=\"NS376\"/>\n* Madara is shown having to deactivate his Rinnegan to his Mangekyō Sharingan to perform this technique.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 588, page 8</ref><ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 339</ref> However, this wasn't required in Sasuke's usage.<ref name=\"chpt692\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Uchiha Clan| ]]\n[[id:Genjutsu: Sharingan]]\n[[es:Genjutsu: Sharingan]]\n[[it: Arte Illusoria: Sharingan]]\n[[pl:Genjutsu: Sharingan]]\n[[fr:Genjutsu - Sharingan]]"
