With Izanagi, the user applies an illusion to reality itself, giving the user control over what is and is not real for as long as Izanagi is active. Users typically do this in order to protect themselves, negating any injuries they receive or even their deaths. When this happens, their injured self fades away as an illusion and their non-injured self immediately materialises in the previous self's place.<ref name=\"c479\">''Naruto'' chapter 479, pages 2-4</ref> In the anime, users are shown extending Izanagi's influence beyond their personal reality, affecting their surroundings and those within it.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 338</ref>\n\nIzanagi is based on the [[Creation of All Things Technique]], used by the [[Sage of Six Paths]] to turn imagination into reality. The process is explained to use [[spiritual energy]] – which forms the basis of [[Yin Release]] – to create shape from nothingness. Then, through the application of [[physical energy]] – which forms the basis of [[Yang Release]] – the shape has life breathed into it.<ref name=\"c510\">''Naruto'' chapter 510, pages 10-11</ref> Members of the [[Uchiha clan]], as descendants of the Sage, perform Izanagi with their [[Sharingan]]. In exchange for the brief control over reality that Izanagi grants them, the Sharingan that they perform it with becomes blind;<ref name=\"c479\"/> only awakening the [[Rinnegan]] restores the eye's vision.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 681, pages 14</ref> Because the Uchiha prized their Sharingan, to lose it in this way prompted them to label it [[kinjutsu]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 478, pages 17</ref>\n\nBecause Uchiha only possess half of the Sage's chakra, they can only keep Izanagi active for a few seconds;<ref name=\"c479\"/> the exact amount of time depends on the user's power potential.<ref name=\"d4\"/> To maximise Izanagi's duration, it is necessary to recreate the Sage's chakra by also having genetic material of the Sage's other descendants, the [[Senju]].<ref name=\"c510\"/> [[Danzō Shimura]] receives both [[Shin Uchiha|Uchiha]] and [[Hashirama|Senju]] implants,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 700+7</ref> allowing him to use Izanagi for one minute. As this is still not very long, he has ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm, giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi with breaks in between as he chooses.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 479, page 5</ref> Since he is not an Uchiha, each use of Izanagi causes Danzō's [[chakra]] to drop significantly.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 479, page 12</ref> [[Obito Uchiha]], because he has control over the Senju cells he uses, is able to keep a single Izanagi active for significantly longer than Danzō.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 510, page 12</ref>\n\nAs with other Sharingan-based techniques, Izanagi can be programmed to activate under certain conditions. [[Madara Uchiha]] did so to undo his death after he'd been entombed, restoring him to life unbeknownst to anyone.<ref name=\"c681\">''Naruto'' chapter 681, pages 13</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nLike the various techniques used with the Sharingan, this technique is named after a [[Wikipedia:Shinto|Shintō]] [[Wikipedia:Kami|god]]. In this case, it is [[Wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]], who, together with his sister and wife [[Wikipedia:Izanami|Izanami]], created the islands and other deities of Japan.\n\nOne of the most famous stories about Izanagi tells the tale of how he goes into [[Wikipedia:Yomi|Yomi]], the Japanese underworld, to retrieve Izanami after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, [[Wikipedia:Kagu-tsuchi|Kagutsuchi]]. In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape. Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form. Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave. Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day. In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day. In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\n\nAfter his failed attempt to get Izanami, he washed himself in a stream. As he cleaned his left eye, [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] was born, as he cleaned his right eye, [[Wikipedia:Tsukuyomi|Tsukuyomi]] was born, and as he cleaned his nose, [[Wikipedia:Susanoo|Susanoo]] was born.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Because members of the Uchiha clan previously abused the use of Izanagi, [[Izanami]] was created as a way to punish those who would misuse it. Like Izanagi, Izanami also blinds the Sharingan that it is performed with.<ref name=\"c587\">''Naruto'' chapter 587, pages 4-6</ref>\n* During initial depictions of Izanagi, the blindness it causes is represented by the eye's lids closing.<ref name=\"c479\"/><ref name=\"c510\"/> After the blindness caused by Izanami is depicted as turning the eye a blank white,<ref name=\"c587\"/> Izanagi starts being depicted the same way.<ref name=\"c681\"/>\n* In the ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja (series)|Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'' series, Danzō uses this as part of his ultimate technique, letting his Wood Release go out of control, creating a tree that crushes both himself and the opponent, and activating Izanagi at the last moment to escape unharmed.\n* Despite Madara using a time-activated Izanagi in the manga, he is not listed as a user of Izanagi in ''[[Jin no Sho]]''.<ref name=\"d4\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Izanagi]]\n[[es:Izanagi]]\n[[ka:იზანაგი]]\n[[ru:Изанаги]]\n[[fr:Izanagi]]\n[[pl:Izanagi]]\n[[uk:Ідзанаґі]]"
