As they descend in succession along the same trajectory, if one of these meteorites is stopped, the user can summon another one to then [[Wikipedia:Newton's cradle|collide]] with the first, ensuring that they crash into their intended destination.\n\nThe impact of this technique was of such enormity that it devastated a significant portion of the [[Fourth Division]], with the resulting tremors felt from the border of the [[Land of Lightning]] to as far away as the [[Allied Shinobi Forces]]' [[Allied Shinobi Forces' Headquarters|headquarters]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 561, page 6</ref> It was also able to completely destroy Madara's Susanoo, and obliterate his body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 561, page 8</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While not named in the manga and anime, it was named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'' and ''J-Stars Victory Vs''.\n** As a nod to Madara's own body being affected by this technique, the latter game while with no direct damage involved, can allow Madara and his ally to be affected by the blast radius of the second portion as friendly fire (which however does not add any combo hit counts unlike hitting enemies with it).\n* The sheer enormity of this technique caused the Fourth Division to question if it could even be called [[ninjutsu]], with [[Gaara]] believing it to be a power comparable to a god's.\n* After becoming the [[Ten Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]], Madara's usage of Chibaku Tensei created several meteors similar to the ones this technique summons.\n* When the second meteor first dropped, it looked almost perfectly spherical, but when Madara awakened his [[Susanoo|Complete Body Susanoo]] from his armoured Susanoo, it looked elongated vertically.\n* In the anime and video games, the hand seal held by Madara changes from the manga to be a Ram seal instead of a Snake seal.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Banshō Ten'in]]\n* [[Chibaku Tensei]]\n* [[Shinra Tensei]]\n* [[True: Chibaku Tensei]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Tengai Shinsei]]\n[[fr:Technique de la Météorite]]\n[[id:Tengai Shinsei]]\n[[pl:Tengai Shinsei]]\n[[pt-br:Tengai Shinsei]]"
