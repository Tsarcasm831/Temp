The user then flattens themselves to paper-like thinness and merges with the target's shadow, giving them complete control over the target's mind and body. The user must hold their breath in order to maintain this control.<ref name=\"d3\"/> [[Jiraiya]] uses this technique on [[Ryūsui]] with the intention of exploring [[Amegakure]] and gathering intel, but he is quickly spotted by [[Konan]] speaking to a [[toad]]. Although Konan immediately knows that it's Jiraiya because of what she overhears, she focuses her attacks on Ryūsui's body, evidently believing him to be Jiraiya in disguise despite her prior knowledge of this technique.<ref name=\"c371\">''Naruto'' chapter 371</ref> In this way, the controlled body is useful as a shield,<ref name=\"d3\"/> and while it's taking attacks meant for the user, the user is able to prepare their own attacks unnoticed.<ref name=\"c371\"/>\n\nTo release this technique, users inhale deeply, causing their body to inflate back to its normal thickness.<ref name=\"d3\"/> Their targets simultaneously regain control of their body and senses, with no apparent memory of what happened while they were being controlled.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 372</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Jiraiya maintains his original outline while posing as Ryūsui's shadow, with the large scroll he carries on his back still plainly visible.<ref name=\"c371\"/>\n* Jiraiya has also been shown flattening his body in order to hide against a wall.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 378, pages 12-13</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Hiding in Shadow Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Manipulation des Ombres de Gama Daïra]]\n[[it:Fantoccio d'Ombra della Rana Piatta]]\n[[pl:Gamadaira — Kageayatsuri no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Manipulação da Sombra do Sapo Achatado]]"
