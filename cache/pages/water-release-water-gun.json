Using this technique, Gamariki can blast off a wave of [[Wikipedia:Fluid pressure|high speed water]] from his mouth with extreme precision and force. When combined with another person's [[chakra]], this technique becomes a two-way collaboration water technique that can slice the target into multiple fine-carved pieces. After he learns this technique, Gamatatsu is able to combine it with [[Naruto]]'s [[wind]]-natured chakra to create the [[Wind Release: Toad Gun]] technique.\n\n== Trivia == \n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles]]'', [[Naruto]]'s [[Dragon Blade]] enables him to perform this technique.\n\n[[pl:Suiton: Mizudeppō]]"
