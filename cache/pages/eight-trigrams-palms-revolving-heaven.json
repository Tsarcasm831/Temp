[[Neji Hyūga]], a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. The moment before the Hyūga is struck by an attack, they emit [[chakra]] from all of their body's [[tenketsu]] to block it. They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin.<ref name=\"c101\">''Naruto'' chapter 101, pages 7-8</ref> The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 104, pages 15</ref> The user is capable of defending not only themselves but multiple people.<ref>''Naruto Shippūden'' Episode 184</ref>\n\nRevolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hyūga's [[Byakugan]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 195, page 13</ref> But in this regard it is quite effective, leading [[Tenten]] to describe it as an [[absolute defence]] superior to the [[Shield of Sand]].<ref name=\"c101\"/> While normally a short-range manoeuvre, with greater skill one can increase both the range and momentum of the rotating chakra shield as [[Hiashi Hyūga]] can repel attackers from several feet away and did so with such force that it ploughed the ground around him, cratering the terrain he was on save for the location he was standing at.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 137, page 9</ref> The only effective means of countering the Revolving Heaven is to prevent the Hyūga from spinning;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 195, page 4</ref> the anime sometimes depicts it being used without spinning.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 61</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|\"Kaiten\"|回天|lit meaning=revolving heaven}} is a term used to refer to turning the tides or fighting back up from a weak position. When written as {{translation|\"回転\"||kaiten}}, it means \"revolving\" or \"spinning\".\n* In the anime, Revolving Heaven is shown to reach speeds of at least about 1200 km/h (745.6 mph). If an opponent can exceed this speed in the direction of the rotation, they can breach the defence.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 377</ref>\n* In the anime, if the user does not have focus and precise chakra control when the Revolving Heaven is executed, the user will repel themselves out of the technique.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 380</ref>\n* In the anime, the [[Genjutsu World]]'s [[Hinata Hyūga]] can use this technique.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 428</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Tourbillon Divin du Hakke]]\n[[pl:Hakkeshō Kaiten]]\n[[pt-br:Oito Trigramas: Palma Rotativa]]\n[[ru:Восемь Триграмм Небесное Вращение]]"
