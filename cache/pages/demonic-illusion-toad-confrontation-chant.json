Therefore, they rely on allies to fend off or distract opponents until they're ready.<ref name=\"c378\">''Naruto'' chapter 378, pages 8-9</ref>\n\nOnce the toads have harmonized and have begun singing, all opponents – regardless of number or skill – who hear it will fall under the genjutsu's influence. Within the illusion, the victim's mind and movements are sealed within a [[barrier]] of water by four toad samurai. Meanwhile, the users and their victims can still interact and communicate.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 379, pages 5-6</ref> The genjutsu can only be undone when the user gives the order or by having Mount Myōboku's secret [[Stone Swords]] driven into the victim's heart.<ref name=\"d3\"/> After the song is finished, the toads' throats are left strained and require rest.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 379, page 9</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Ilusión Demoníaca: Canto de Confrontación de Sapo]]\n[[fr:Illusion Démoniaque - Chant de Confrontation du Crapaud]]\n[[pt-br:Ilusão Demoníaca: Confronto do Canto de Sapo]]\n[[pl:Magen: Gama Rinshō]]"
