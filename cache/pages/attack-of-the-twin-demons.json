This allows Ukon to help Sakon in combat in ways that Sakon would not be able to do alone, such as emerging from Sakon's back to intercept surprise attacks or producing hands from Sakon's head to attack from angles that Sakon cannot. Alternatively, Ukon can add his [[Multiple Connected Fists|fists to Sakon's punches]] and [[Multiple Connected Feet|feet to Sakon's kicks]], tripling their power. Until opponents become aware of Ukon's presence, they are likely to be confused by Sakon's inexplicable and unpredictable combat ability.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Ukon can fully emerge from Sakon's body so that they can work together,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 204</ref> but because of how much time he spends in Sakon's body he isn't used to independent movement and thus tires easily.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 205</ref>\n\nAfter integrating Sakon's cells into his body, [[Kabuto Yakushi]] is able to use this technique to generate [[Strange Transmission Distant Shadow|mindless clones]] of other shinobi, including the [[Sound Five]] and [[Orochimaru]], from his own body in order to perform their techniques.<ref name=\"ch585\">''Naruto'' chapter 585</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When Kabuto uses this technique, he refers to it as {{translation|\"Sakon: Twin Demons Technique\"|左近・双魔の術|Sakon: Sōma no Jutsu}}.<ref name=\"ch585\"/>\n* In the [[Jin no Sho|fourth databook]], \"Attack of the Twin Demons\" and \"Twin Demons Technique\" are both mentioned by name in the [[Strange Transmission Distant Shadow]] entry, which may imply a difference between the two.<ref name=\"d4\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Souma no Kou]]\n[[fr:Attaque des Démons Jumeaux]]\n[[pl:Sōma no Kō]]\n[[pt-br:Ataque dos Demônios Gêmeos]]"
