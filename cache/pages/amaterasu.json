However, with enough speed, it is possible to [[Lightning Release Chakra Mode|avoid]], dodge,<ref>Boruto episode 218</ref> or [[Shield of Sand|intercept]] the [[jutsu]] after it has been cast.<ref name=\"c463p12\">''Naruto'' chapter 463, page 12</ref><ref name=\"c464p12\">''Naruto'' chapter 464, page 12</ref> Said to be \"the fires from hell\" and to burn as hot as the sun itself,<ref name=\"d2\"/> Amaterasu burns any material — [[Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique|other flames]] included — until nothing but ash remains.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 390, page 1</ref> Throughout the series some objects have shown a degree of imperviousness to the flames, such as [[Gaara]]'s [[Shield of Sand|chakra-infused sand]]<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 464, page 12</ref> and Naruto's [[Version 1]] chakra cloak.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 697, pages 6-7</ref> Befitting their description as never disappearing and immortal,<ref name=\"d4\">Fourth Databook, page 236</ref> Amaterasu's flames cannot be extinguished through most conventional means and will continue burning until their target is completely incinerated;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 391, page 5</ref> only the user can put out the flames.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 415, pages 7-8</ref>\n\nAmaterasu does not ordinarily require [[hand seal]]s to be performed, though [[Sasuke Uchiha]] once used the Tiger hand seal, which is common for fire techniques.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 682, page 4</ref> This technique can also be [[Transcription Seal: Amaterasu|sealed]] within the Sharingan of another person.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 397, pages 1-4</ref> Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 463, page 15</ref>\n\nUse of this technique puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. Though the user can make Amaterasu incinerate things near-instantly when focusing on it, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly normally, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body part(s) before it spreads.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 635, page 13</ref> Other defensive options are [[Shinra Tensei|pushing the flames away]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 550, page 14</ref> [[Preta Path|absorbing them through the Rinnegan]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 657, pages 2-3</ref> [[Kāma]] absorption,<ref>Boruto episode 204</ref> certain [[Kamui|space–time ninjutsu]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 397, pages 2-8</ref> or being the [[jinchūriki]] of the [[Ten-Tails]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 642, page 1-3</ref> While impractical as a defence, Amaterasu can also be [[Fire Sealing Method|sealed]].\n\nBecause of the ability of his right Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke can control and shape the flames of Amaterasu using [[Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi]].\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]], like [[Wikipedia:Tsukuyomi|Tsukuyomi]] and [[Wikipedia:Susanoo|Susanoo]], is a god in ancient Japanese myth and the Shintō religion. Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, was born from the left eye of [[Wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]] when he performed the cleansing ritual after escaping the underworld.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite being initially described as spawning at the user's point of focus,<ref name=\"c390p3\" /> Amaterasu has at times been depicted as traveling through space towards its targets, making it possible for other high speed techniques to counter it.<ref name=\"c463p12\" /><ref name=\"c464p12\" /><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 641, page 8</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hinokagutsuchi]]\n* [[True Fire of Samadhi]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Amaterasu]]\n[[ru:Аматерасу]]\n[[es:Amaterasu]]\n[[pl:Amaterasu]]\n[[pt-br:Amaterasu]]\n[[id:Amaterasu]]\n[[fr:Amaterasu]]\n[[tr:Amaterasu]]\n[[uk:Аматерасу]]"
