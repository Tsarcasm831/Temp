As he strikes his opponent, he uses [[Shape Transformation]] to extend the Chidori into a lightning spear that impales and hurtles the opponent into the air. Sasuke then increases the potency of the lightning, generating a powerful electric explosion at the end of the spear and sending the opponent back to the ground.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|Shinsō|真槍}} means \"spear\", but when the kanji are read separately, it means \"true spear\". True means that it's a real spear and not one used for training.\n\n[[es:Chidori: Lanza Verdadera]]\n[[pl:Chidori Shinsō]]"
