A successful strike can blow away a target's entire chest with a direct hit, which may not kill them right away, but will ultimately kill them if they are not treated. The attack is rather straightforward, but very quick, powerful and is easily capable of knocking down an opponent.\n\n== Variants ==\n* When Killer B uses this attack, he creates either a [[Version 1|chakra cloak]] or [[Version 2|chakra bones]], both in the form of bull horns. He refers to this as his {{translation|\"Eighth\"|八本目|Happonme}} sword, next to his seven conventional katana. In Killer B's Version 2, the Lariat gains an increase in power due to the ox-skull he creates. He was able to pierce [[Samehada]] while simultaneously blowing away [[Kisame Hoshigaki]]'s chest.\n* When A uses it, he surrounds himself with his [[Lightning Release Chakra Mode]], rather than tailed-beast chakra. His high-level chakra, which is comparable to that of a tailed beast's, would produce the same effect as Killer B's version. The two brothers can combine their efforts to perform a [[Lightning Release: Double Lariat]], which is strong enough to decapitate the victim, even without chakra enhancements, due to the brothers' immense physical strength.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 542, page 7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique appears to be a signature skill that all Raikage are taught. Also, it is taught to the ninja, usually the Raikage's sibling, who earns the title of \"B\" so as to be a tag-team partner with the Raikage and be able to perform this technique [[Lightning Release: Double Lariat|simultaneously]] on the same target.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 541, page 13</ref>\n* As with many of the techniques of [[Kumogakure]] ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as ''Rairi Nettō''.\n* Similarly to the Fourth Raikage's [[Liger Bomb]], the Lariat is a highly feared move within [[Wikipedia:Puroresu|Puroresu]] (Japanese professional wrestling). Killer B even shouts \"Wheee!\" when attacking with the Lariat, a nod to pro wrestler [[Wikipedia:Stan Hansen|Stan Hansen]] who popularised the Lariat in Japan.\n* In the ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'', [[Might Guy]]'s \"[[Oneself's Rule]]\" shows him performing what appears to be a regular lariat.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Lariat]]\n[[fr:Raiton - Lariat]]\n[[pl:Raiton: Rariatto]]"
