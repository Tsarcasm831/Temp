It was developed by En no Gyōja, and his granddaughter [[Hotaru]] had the kinjutsu implanted on her back. [[Tonbee]] stated that En no Gyōja gave him the scroll to unseal and destroy the deadly [[kinjutsu]].\n\n== Usage ==\nBefore the technique can be performed, the user must first gather a large amount of [[chakra]] by using the [[Tsuchigumo Style: Forbidden Life Technique Release: Creation of Heaven and Earth]] to power it. Seeing the technique's enormous potential as a weapon of mass destruction, the [[Third Hokage]] proclaimed this as a kinjutsu, so as to keep [[Konohagakure|his village]] safe. Despite the technique's power, [[Utakata]] was able to absorb all its power and destroy it by using his [[Tailed Beast Mode]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In exchange for declaring Fury as a kinjutsu, the Third Hokage and En no Gyōja made a treaty that Konoha will lend aid to the Tsuchigumo Clan in times of need.\n\n[[es:Furia]]\n[[fr:Fureur Divine]]\n[[pl:Dohatsuten]]\n[[pt-br:Fúria]]"
