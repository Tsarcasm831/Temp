Once activated Yomito transforms into an [[Wikipedia:Oni (folklore)|oni]]-like creature. His body greatly grows in size and becomes very muscular, his skin becomes grey and his hair becomes crimson. The only clothes that remain are his pants. He also gains a necklace of large, dark green beads and a crimson marking on the back of each arm, right above his elbows. In this form Yomito makes use of the enormous fists it grants him, using them to smash the ground or chuck rocks out of it to attack from a distance. The only vulnerable spot seems to be his head and he has to somehow be knocked down for it to be reached.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Tailed Beast Replication]]\n* ''[[Taisa's Transformation Technique]]''\n* [[Transformation Technique]]\n* [[Wood Release: Transformation]]\n\n[[pl:Technika Transformacji Yomito]]"
