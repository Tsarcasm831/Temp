The process he used is explained to have initially involved the administration of imagination, and the spiritual energy which forms the basis of [[Yin]] [[chakra]] to create physical forms from nothingness. Then, through the application of vitality, and the physical energy which forms the basis of [[Yang]] chakra, he would breathe life into the resulting creations. The [[tailed beasts]] were created from the [[Ten-Tails]]' chakra with this technique.\n\nIn the anime, when using this ability, the beings created are minuscule and surrounded by a magatama-like green energy pod.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 462</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is said that Izanagi is simply a practical application of this technique.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 510, page 11</ref>\n* According to [[Obito Uchiha]], the Sage of the Six Paths used this ability to create many things besides the tailed beasts.\n* During his fight with [[Naruto Uzumaki]], [[Sasuke Uchiha]] merged all of the tailed beasts' chakra using [[Susanoo]] as a vessel. [[Kurama]] described this act as being on par with Hagoromo's creation of the tailed beasts, except in reverse.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 696</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[it:Tecnica della Creazione Universale]]\n[[es:Banbutsu Sōzō]]\n[[fr:Banbutsu Sôzô]]\n[[pl:Banbutsu Sōzō no Jutsu]]"
