After throwing a single [[shuriken]], the user duplicates it with their [[chakra]], in the same way that the [[Shadow Clone Technique]] makes copies of the user; creating shadow clones is already difficult on its own, but specifically duplicating inanimate objects is even more difficult. In an instant, the thousand copied shuriken spread throughout the area, surrounding the target. Because the shuriken are physically real, the target is attacked from every direction, which they have almost no chance of completely avoiding.<ref name=\"d1\" />\n\nIn the manga, the duplicated shuriken simply appear out of thin air. In some anime depictions, the shuriken's creation is marked by a puff of smoke, just as happens when normal shadow clones are created.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 378</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, a member of the [[Watari Ninja]] - masquerading as the [[Cursed Warrior]] - performed this technique.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 163</ref>\n* In the anime, a young [[Jiraiya]] attempted to perform this technique. Calling it the \"Shuriken Whatever Technique\", he simply threw a bunch of shuriken after the first one.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 361</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Naruto Uzumaki]] uses the Shadow Clone Technique's [[hand seal]] to perform the technique.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 65</ref>\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower]]'', [[Minato]] uses this technique to duplicate his [[Flying Thunder God Kunai]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Bō Shadow Clone Technique]]''\n* [[Multiple Phantom Shuriken]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Shuriken Multi Clonage]]\n[[id:Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[pl:Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Clone da Sombra de Shuriken]]"
