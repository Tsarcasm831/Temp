This attack was strong enough to push back [[Obito Uchiha]] as the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 645, page 14</ref>\n\n=== Naruto and Boruto's Version ===\n[[File:Boruto and Naruto's Combined Rasengan.png|thumb|left|Naruto and Boruto's combined Rasengan.]]\nBoruto starts off by generating a tiny Rasengan. Clasping Boruto's hand, Naruto then adds his own chakra to the Rasengan, forming a gargantuan sphere, which dwarfs both of them in size. Boruto used this technique to kill [[Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki]], on top of obliterating his [[Rinnegan]]-enhanced Rasengan and [[Tailed Beast Ball]],<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 9, page 37</ref> as well as a [[God Tree]].<ref name=\"BorutoMovie\">''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Though clearly not a normal Rasengan, it was simply called the Rasengan in the ''Boruto'' manga and ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''.\n* In the novelisation of ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'' as well as the anime adaptation in ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'', the Rasengan that Naruto and Boruto created functioned the same as Boruto's [[Vanishing Rasengan]] on a more powerful scale.\n* While transferring his chakra into Boruto's Rasengan, Naruto was also able to somehow [[Ninshū|convey]] his memories of his past, detailing his suffering and struggles while fulfilling his dream to become Hokage.<ref name=\"BorutoMovie\"/>''\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Husband and Wife Rasengan]]\n* [[Student and Teacher: Rasengan]]\n* [[Supreme Ultimate Rasengan]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pt-br:Rasengan Pai e Filho]]\n[[fr:Orbe Tourbillonnant Parent et Enfant]]\n[[id:Oyako Rasengan]]\n[[pl:Oyako Rasengan]]\n[[ru:Расенган Родителя и Ребёнка]]"
