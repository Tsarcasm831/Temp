This technique is mainly used to restrict the movement of the target by coating a target's body,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 637, pages 14-16</ref><ref name=\"ch656\">''Naruto'' chapter 656, pages 16-17</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 678, pages 14-16</ref> and forcibly make them do its bidding by directly channelling its will through them. In possession of the target's body, Black Zetsu is also able to use target's techniques,<ref name=\"ch656\" /> [[kekkei genkai]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 676, page 1</ref> as well as any other ability they may possess. By using this technique, Black Zetsu can perform various feats including controlling the target, and even stabilising their life force allowing them to live following a [[Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique|mortally-taxing]] event.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 657, page 10</ref> \n\nOnce in contact with a target, they can also [[Chakra Absorption Techniques|absorb]]<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 664, pages 14-16</ref> the target's [[chakra]] and transfer it to others,<ref name=\"ch681\" /> and even show the target events it has [[Event Recording|recorded]].<ref name=\"ch681\">''Naruto'' chapter 681</ref> One drawback of this technique, is that if the target has a strong enough will as in the case of Obito they can suppress Black Zetsu's influence, and take advantage of Black Zetsu being attached to them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 665, page 3</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* As shown with [[Obito]], any invulnerability Black Zetsu has, such as immunity to the [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]], is transferred to its host at the time.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Recouvrement du Corps]]\n[[pl:Technika Okrywania]]"
