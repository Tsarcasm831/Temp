It was powerful enough to punch through [[Gaara]]'s [[Shield of Sand]] and send the young shinobi crashing through a wall.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although the Japanese subtitle of this technique is written in kanji, it is pronounced in English, {{Translation|\"Thunder Saber\"|サンダーサーブル|Sandā Sāburu}}. The Japanese pronunciation of the kanji would be ''Raikō Shōhatotsu'', which would literally translate to \"Flash of Lightning Collision Break\".\n\n[[es:Sables de Trueno]]\n[[pl:Sandā Sāburu]]"
