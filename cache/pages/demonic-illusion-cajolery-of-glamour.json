It allows the user to put their opponent under an illusion using only words and speech. By infusing [[chakra]] into the tongue of the user, any target within auditory range of the user will become easily swayed in a post-hypnotic trance of their will and self-assurance; forcing them to face their innermost trauma as realised by the user's words in an effort to mentally break their spirit. Once told to look behind their back the genjutsu becomes complete, causing them to {{translation|'''awaken'''|覚醒|Kakusei}} as an obedient follower of the user.\n \nThe illusion itself cannot be easily broken, even when the person is under realisation that the genjutsu is in effect, but strong emotional connections, like love, can help in dispelling it. Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely. Likewise, echoes and acoustics that enhance the user's voice can make the genjutsu more effective to sway the target.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While not named in the anime or the novel, the technique was given a proper name in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing]]''.\n* [[Kankurō]] indirectly references this from [[Gaara]]'s Tale DLC in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''.\n\n[[pt-br:Ilusão Demoníaca: Encantamento de Persuasão]]\n[[fr:Illusion Démoniaque - Cajolerie de Charme]]\n[[pl:Magen: Kowaku no Kangen]]"
