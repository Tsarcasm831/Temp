The said chakra becomes poisonous to the target, making their bodies unstable. Should the target then begin to bleed, the chakra will be set off, causing the victim's body to become consumed in a pitch-black substance before inflating in a grotesque manner and finally exploding on a large and on a very destructive scale. Only by blocking the chakra flow of the target or rendering them unconscious will nullify mutation and following explosion. With proper medical aid, the [[poison]]ous chakra can be extracted, saving the victim completely.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Clone Great Explosion]]\n* [[Exploding Insect]]\n* [[Suicide Bombing Clone]]\n\n[[pt-br:Ketsuryugan: Humano Explosivo]]"
