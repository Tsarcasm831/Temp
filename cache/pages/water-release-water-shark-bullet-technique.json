As it moves, the body of water takes the shape of a shark, with additional water following in its wake for as long as the user keeps their hand thrust out. Because of how quickly the shark moves and because of how much water there is, it does extensive damage when it impacts something.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Users can also ride within the water shark as it moves, allowing them to travel faster than they're able to swim.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 506, page 6</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, when Kisame rides the shark, it flies through the air rather than swimming through the water.<ref>''Naruto Shippūden'' episode 250</ref>\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes]]'', the shark is depicted as purple instead of blue.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Suiton - Requin Élémentaire Aqueux]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Suikōdan no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Água: Técnica da Bomba do Tubarão de Água]]"
