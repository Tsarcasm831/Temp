The sphere will then split into five smaller versions. After which the user can launch the attack. If the attack collides with another attack, the barrier will take the damage, releasing the five spheres so the attack can continue its path. Upon contact, the spheres will disperse in a fairly large explosion.\n\n== Influence ==\nThe name of this technique is derived from the pillar built by [[wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]] and [[wikipedia:Izanami|Izanami]] in preparation for their mating.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While unnamed in the anime, this technique was named in ''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]''.\n* [[wikipedia:Rahu|Rahu]] is one of the nine celestial bodies in Hindu texts and the king of the meteors. It represents the ascension of the Moon in its precessional orbit around the Earth. In Japanese however, Rahu would be actually formatted as \"Ragō\" (羅喉).\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Rasengan]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[pl:Amenomihashira]]"
