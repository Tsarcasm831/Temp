Once activated, Taisa transforms into an armoured beetle similar to a [[Wikipedia:Japanese rhinoceros beetle|kabutomushi]]. He then gains six legs which are mostly bandaged up, five horns, and orange and violet markings all over his back body. In this form, Taisa is able to make powerful charge attacks with his horns and can release a [[Poison Mist]] from his body. He is also able to leap high into the air and land down on the enemy with great force. The only vulnerable part of this form is his underbelly, and he has to somehow be tipped over for an attack to reach it."
