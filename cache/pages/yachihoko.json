Yachihoko is a powerful Genjutsu, and works by erasing the memories of any individual it targets, creating puppets that Nanashi is able to manipulate. The Genjutsu itself is powerful enough that even a perfect [[Jinchūriki]], such as [[Naruto Uzumaki]], was unable to have it dispelled by his [[Tailed Beast]], [[Kurama]].\n\nYachihoko also allows for the manipulation of chakra from to and from the user via those marked with the Engraved Tsukuyomi blemish. Merz was able to absorb the chakra of a vast portion of the Shinobi World using Yachihoko. Additionally, Nanashi could transfer chakra this way, giving it to Boruto on two occasions to allow him to fight.\n\n== Influence ==\nLike other Mangekyō Sharingan abilities, this one takes its name from ancient Japanese myth. {{translation|Yachihoko-no-Kami|<ruby>八千矛神<rt>やちほこのかみ</rt></ruby> or <ruby>八千戈神<rt>やちほこのかみ</rt></ruby>||lit. \"God of Eight Thousand Spears\"}} is a name adopted in the ''Kojiki'' by the Shintō god {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Ōkuninushi|Ōkuninushi]]|<ruby>大国主<rt>オオクニヌシ</rt></ruby>}}, the head of the ''[[Wikipedia:Kunitsukami|kunitsukami]]'' who governs the earth, nation-building, and agriculture, among other domains.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Genjutsu Cursed Seal]]''\n* [[Kotoamatsukami]]\n* [[Tsukuyomi]]\n\n[[pl:Yachihoko]]"
