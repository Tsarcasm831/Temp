Users fill the air with mist and control its thickness with their [[chakra]]. Once the mists are thick enough that opponents cannot see, that in turn means they cannot manage much defence against the user. [[Zabuza Momochi]] famously used this technique to perform [[Silent Killing|assassination]]s;<ref name=\"d1\"/> although he also could not see within the mists, he was able to locate his targets based only on the sounds they made.<ref name=\"c26\">''Naruto'' chapter 26</ref> The mists can be created using water from the surroundings,<ref name=\"d1\"/> or users can create the mists themselves, which they exhale from their mouths.<ref name=\"c563\"/> If the mists are made thick enough, they can cancel out the enhanced vision of the [[Sharingan]] and [[Rinnegan]].<ref name=\"c26\"/><ref name=\"c563\"/> In the anime, [[Byakugan]] users are able to see through the mists.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 153</ref> [[Sensor]]s also can still find targets despite the lost visibility.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 523, page 8</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In [[The Secret Weapon is Called…|''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 15]], [[Itachi Uchiha]] claims that the mist does not prevent him from using his Sharingan, contradicting both the manga and earlier anime scenes.\n* In one of the cutscenes for ''[[Naruto Mobile]]'', the mist Zabuza forms spreads out from his body in a vortex that can deflect [[shuriken]] and [[kunai]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Secret Technique: Mist Rain]]\n* ''[[Water Release: Hiding in Water Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Ocultación en la Niebla]]\n[[fr:Camouflage dans la Brume]]\n[[pl:Kirigakure no Jutsu]]\n[[ru:Дзюцу укрытия в тумане]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Ocultação na Névoa]]"
