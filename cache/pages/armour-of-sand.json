As the name implies, Gaara covers his body in a layer of [[sand]], wearing it like armour. Although it defends him from attacks that bypass his Shield of Sand, maintaining it consumes a great deal of [[chakra]]. Furthermore, it does not activate automatically like the Shield of Sand does (instead relying on Gaara to apply when needed), nor is it as resilient;<ref name=\"d1\"/> wherever part of the Armour of Sand is struck, that section of it crumbles away. The sand itself also weighs Gaara down, slowing him and placing greater strain on his movements. Despite all this, the Armour of Sand's combination with the Shield of Sand is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 83</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Armour of Sticky Gold]]\n* [[Crystal Armour]]\n* [[Earth Release: Hardening Technique]]\n* [[Earth Release: Earth Spear]]\n* [[Lava Release Chakra Mode]]\n* [[Lightning Release Chakra Mode]]\n* [[Rock Armour]]\n* [[Sand Cloak Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Armadura de Arena]]\n[[fr:Armure de Sable]]"
