The trees' life force is immense enough to split the earth as they sprout and further pierce through any other obstructions they encounter. This growth is also fast enough that it can capture targets before they have a chance to escape. Hashirama used this technique to serve as a foundation for [[Konohagakure]]; none other than Hashirama have been capable of such a feat.<ref name=\"d2\"/> In the anime, [[Kinoe]] attempted to use this technique, but failed.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 355</ref> Years later, he instead uses [[Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees]], a similar yet smaller-scale version of this technique.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{Translation|\"Sea of trees\"|樹海|jukai}} is an idiom referring to a large expanse of dense woodland. This technique changed the last kanji from {{Translation|sea|海}} to {{Translation|world|界}}, probably to reinforce the greatness of the forest created.\n* In ''[[Tō no Sho]]'', this technique is classified as [[hiden]] instead of a [[kekkei genkai]].<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Mokuton - Technique Secrète - Croissance Luxuriante de la Forêt]]\n[[pl:Mokuton Hijutsu: Jukai Kōtan]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Secreta Estilo Madeira: Nascimento do Mundo de Árvores]]"
