One method of doing this is for the user to convert [[chakra]] in their body into an earthen material that they spit from their mouth; the more skilled the user, the greater the volume of earth that can be created. The earth quickly piles up into a defensive wall, blocking incoming attacks. Although the muddy material is solid on its own, it is further fortified with a coat of chakra, making it more resistant to [[fire]] and [[water]] than it would otherwise be.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nA second method of performing this technique is to instead manipulate pre-existing earth directly: by placing their hands on the ground, users can raise the ground as a barrier in front of them.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 16</ref> Walls erected in this way are typically featureless, but users can alter the appearance if they choose; [[Kakashi Hatake]] adorns his with [[Wikipedia:Bulldog|bulldog]] sculptures. Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 420, page 8</ref> or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 87</ref> The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.<!--vague. what are these far walls being used for?--><ref>''Boruto'' episode 69</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Kakashi Retsuden]]'', the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], to make up for the loss of his [[Sharingan]]. His improved Earth-Style Wall is large enough to surround a small village, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannons, and he can remotely repair any damage it receives. Kakashi is able to maintain such a wall for over a day by himself, something most onlookers believe would require the work of team.<ref>''Kakashi Retsuden'', pages 115-166</ref>\n\n== Trivia == \n* Before his canon usage, in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles]]'', the [[Dragon Blade]] enabled Naruto to perform the technique.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Earth Release: Earth Shore Return]]\n* [[Earth Release: Practice Brick Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Estilo Pared de Tierra]]\n[[fr:Doton - Mur de Terre]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Terra: Parede de Lama]]\n[[pl:Doton: Doryūheki]]\n[[ru:Стихия Земли: Земляная Стена]]"
