Above most other \"[[clone techniques]]\", this clone has the double role. It acts as a substitute and a trap for capturing the enemy. Made from clay, this clone can take attacks and capture the enemy by taking them into its own body. The clone shows its natural shape the instant a body goes through. While the clay changes in hardness, the enemy is skilfully immobilised. If [[explosive clay]] is added to the clone, it can then make itself explode, taking the enemy with it. \n \n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3]]'', the clone is a stronger clay bomb (though not possibly close to the Suicide Bombing Clone) that dives into an opponent from the air before exploding.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Clon de Arcilla]]\n[[fr:Clone d'Argile]]\n[[pl:Nendo Bunshin]]\n[[pt-br:Clone de Argila]]"
