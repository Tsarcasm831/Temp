It then leaps from his mouth with tremendous speed and force, enough to tear a hole through bedrock and metal pipes with ease. With that ground-splitting power, the enemy is cut in half. The way that both the enemy and the ground itself are cut apart is reminiscent of the strike of a great sword.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* ''\"Zessen\"'' is written with the kanji for ''\"tongue\"'' and ''\"battle\"''. It can be translated as to ''\"battle with tongues\"''. In normal use, however, it means ''\"war of words\"'', or ''\"verbal dispute\"'', in reference to Fukasaku and Shima arguing all the time. The full kanji can be translated as \"War of Words Slash\".\n* In the anime, [[Naruto: Colour Edition|colourised manga]], and various video games, Fukasaku is depicted firing a highly pressurised stream of [[water]] from his mouth, rather than extending his tongue.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Water Release: Water Severing Wave]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Batalla de Lengua Cortante]]\n[[fr:Entaille de Langue de Combat]]\n[[pl:Zessenzan]]\n[[pt-br:Corte da Língua de Batalha]]"
