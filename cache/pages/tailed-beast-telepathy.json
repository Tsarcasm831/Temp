This kind of communication differs from the one used by [[jinchūriki]] and their tailed beasts, since there are no seals or other restrictions and it is accessible for all tailed beasts and their respective jinchūriki. However, it requires a jinchūriki and their tailed beast to be fully linked to gain access to this world. Furthermore, it is impossible for influences from the outside to reach this plane, even if the tailed beasts are being controlled.\n\nIt appears that even without a jinchūriki, the tailed beasts are able to contact humans, as Shukaku did with [[Gaara]].<ref>''Boruto'' episode 55</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Mind Body Transmission Technique]]\n* ''[[Wave Transmission Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Télépathie des Démons à Queues]]\n[[pl:Telepatia Ogoniastej Bestii]]\n[[pt-br:Telepatia Bijū]]"
