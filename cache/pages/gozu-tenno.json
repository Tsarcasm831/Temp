[[Sasuke Uchiha]] remarked that it came close to replicating [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]]'s secret techniques.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 15</ref>\n\nThe seal is comprised of [[Hashirama Senju]]'s cells and must be surgically implanted into a compatible vessel, a process which drains a great deal of the caster's vitality, shortening their lifespan; Tanuki died right after he cast it onto his daughter. The seal itself acts as a gateway to a [[Nue's Dimension|separate dimension]] that Tanuki called the {{translation|underworld|異界|ikai}}, wherein dwells a legendary beast named [[Nue]] that is born the moment the seal is completed.<ref>''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Novel 5''</ref>\n\nThe mark acts as a medium for [[Chakra Absorption Techniques|absorbed chakra]] to be transferred into the Nue, nourishing it, as well as a gate through which it can be summoned. It also allows the user to create snake-like creatures out of dark [[chakra]], which can be used in battle or parasitically attached to individuals suffering from negative emotions to continually drain their chakra, further disturbing their mental state. As Nue is fed chakra, the seal's pattern spreads and the beast quickly grows into a gigantic monster, eventually becoming a living chakra bomb that can be summoned to a location and detonated, creating an explosion large enough to destroy an entire city.\n\nThe principal usage of the Gozu Tennō is to send the host into enemy territory to release Nue, who will rampage as much as possible before detonating to wipe out everything, including the host.\n\nAs the true source of power for this technique is negative emotions, if the vessel overcomes these emotions the seal will be destroyed. When [[Sumire Kakei]] achieved this, a portion of the seal remained and migrated to her palm, allowing her to maintain her symbiotic bond with Nue.\n\n== Influence ==\nThe technique's name comes from [[Wikipedia:Gozu Tennō|Gozu Tennō]], a Japanese deity of pestilence.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The strategy of sending Gozu Tennō into enemy territory is similar to how [[Kirigakure]] attempted to send [[Rin Nohara]], whom they made into the [[Jinchūriki]] of [[Isobu]], into [[Konohagakure]] to destroy it. Incidentally, both cases had Konoha as their targets.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[it:Gozu Tenno]]\n[[fr:Gozu Tennô]]\n[[pl:Gozu Tennō]]\n[[pt-br:Gozu Ten'nō]]"
