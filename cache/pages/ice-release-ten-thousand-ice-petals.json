The intensity of the cold is so great, that should a person attempt to block them, it will cause severe damage to the afflicted limb. The user can also use this defensively by creating a wall of ice to create distance between the user and their combatant.\n\nThe hardness of the ice itself along with its momentum is dangerous. A metal sliding door on a [[Thunder Rail]] car was severely dented and deformed when it buckled under an onslaught until it was torn from its frame and railings.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name of this technique is a word play on {{translation|\"kaleidoscope\"|万華鏡|mangekyō}}.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Water Release: Cold Sky Water Attack]]\n\n\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Gelo: Dez Mil Pétalas de Gelo]]\n[[fr:Hyôton - Dix Mille Pétales de Glace]]\n[[pl:Hyōton: Mangehyō]]"
