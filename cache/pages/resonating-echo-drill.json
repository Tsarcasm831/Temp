Dosu can direct the sound waves based on how he moves his arm,<ref name=\"c53\">''Naruto'' chapter 53</ref> or he can guide them at a specific target using his [[chakra]]; because the attack uses sound, it can't be blocked. The sound damages his target's [[wikipedia:semicircular canals|semicircular canals]], throwing them off balance so that they can't stand, move, or fight.<ref name=\"d1\"/> Additional side-effects include bleeding ears, distorted vision, and vomiting.<ref name=\"c53\"/>\n\n[[Chōji Akimichi]] attempts to defend himself from this technique by tucking his head into his [[Multi-Size Technique|expanded body]], effectively plugging his ears. This ends up making things easier for Dosu: because most of the body is composed of water - which is a naturally good conductor of sound - Dosu is able to further amplify the sound waves by emitting them directly into Chōji's body, assailing his hiding ears.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 87</ref> Dosu does something similar against obstacles, focusing the sound waves against them through physical contact in order to decimate them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 51</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 52</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Taladro de Eco Resonante]]\n[[fr:Affection par Sons Perçants]]\n[[pl:Kyōmeisen]]\n[[pt-br:Eco da Broca Ressonante]]"
