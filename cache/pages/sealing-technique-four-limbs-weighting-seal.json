This increases the weight of the beads exponentially, weighing down the target's limbs.\n\nGiven how it would be difficult to perform this technique in actual combat, its primary use is seemingly for training in a style similar to [[Might Guy]] and [[Rock Lee]]. As the target of this technique continues to train, the prayer beads change colour from white to blue, green, yellow and finally to red. Once they're red, this signifies that the training is complete. It is unknown if the prayer beads are an absolute requirement for this technique, or if it can be performed with any significantly weighed article of clothing, which would greatly improve this technique's battle efficiency.\n\n[[es:Jutsu de Sellado: Sellado de Ponderación de Cuatro Extremidades]]\n[[pl:Technika Pieczętująca: Pieczęć Wyważenia Czterech Kończyn]]"
