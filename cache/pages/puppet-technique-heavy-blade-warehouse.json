When opened, the two containers release thousands of [[kunai]] that pierce into the target's body. Then, another set of kunai are loaded into the wooden cylinders attached to the containers. When opened, a full load of kunai with multiple [[explosive tag]]s attached to each are shot to the ground near the target. They then detonate, causing a large explosion.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name \"Jūhako\" is probably meant to invoke the feeling of the word {{translation|\"ohako\"|十八番|favourite trick, speciality|lit meaning=number eighteen}}, which is the word used to describe what Hiruko is to Sasori. The first kanji of this word can also be read as \"jū\", creating \"jūhako\".\n\n[[es:Jutsu de Marioneta: Almacén Abundante de Cuchillas]]\n[[pl:Kugutsu no Jutsu: Jūhako]]"
