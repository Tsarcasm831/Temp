The entities are so realistic that they even have their own [[chakra pathway system]], which can fool even the \"all-seeing\" [[Byakugan]]. When one of these entities is attacked, it vanishes like a ghost and then reappears.\n\nThis technique can also become more effective when used in conjunction with techniques like the [[Hiding in Mist Technique]].\n\n== See Also ==\n*[[Wind Release: Sand Cloud Whirlwind]]\n\n[[pt-br:Genjutsu: Fantasmas de Chakra]]\n[[pl:Technika_Czakry_Ducha]]"
