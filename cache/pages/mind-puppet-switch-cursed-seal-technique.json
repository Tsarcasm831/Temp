When the opponent counters and inflicts damage upon the puppet or the puppet inflicts damage on the enemy, the cursed seal will take effect, causing the kanji {{translation|\"curse\"|呪|noroi}} to disappear from the puppet's forehead and the two consciousness (that of the user's inside the puppet and that of the victim who countered) to switch. Consequently, the user will gain full control of the opponent's body, while the victim's mind remains trapped within the immobile puppet.\n\nLike the [[Mind Body Switch Technique|original technique]], the user's body is left defenceless while the ability is active and any injury done to the victim's body is also reflected upon their true body, but this can be rectified if the user cancels the technique just before any damage is received.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 471, page 7</ref> Unlike the original, the user does not have to worry about the target's will overpowering their own, as it is sealed in the puppet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Puppet Imitation Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Shinten Kugutsu Juin no Jutsu]]\n[[es:Jutsu de Sello Maldito Cambio de Mente de Marioneta]]\n[[fr:Geôle de Paille]]\n[[pl:Shinten Kugutsu Juin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Transferência da Mente por um Boneco Amaldiçoado]]"
