Due to the sheer volume of the punches involved, defending against the entirety of them is nearly impossible. This can be used as a one-shot technique, increasing its destructive power but also resulting in the hands behind the statue's back being destroyed. Afterwards, Hashirama discards the back of the statue to increase the mobility of the True Several Thousand Hands statue. It can also be used more conservatively as seen in Tobi's usage, preventing the hands from being destroyed and enabling another usage of the technique, but results in less destructive power.\n\n== Influence ==\n{{translation|\"Kebutsu\"|化仏|lit meaning=Transformed Buddha}} depicts the manifestation of a [[Wikipedia:Nyorai|Nyorai]] that has transformed into another body, represented alongside an associated [[Wikipedia:Buddhahood|Buddha]] or [[Wikipedia:Bodhisattva|bodhisattva]]. In practical terms, this means a smaller Buddhist image attached to a larger one. \n\nSuch depictions serve as an example of the many forms Buddhist deities can assume  in order to save sentient beings. They are found most notably within the statues of [[Wikipedia:Avalokiteśvara|Kannon]], where a small image of [[Wikipedia:Amitābha|Amida]] is placed atop Kannon's crown or held in the hands of Thousand-Armed Kannon.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]'', Hashirama is shown able to perform a small-scale version of this technique from his own body, called {{translation|\"Wood Release: Strong Thousand Hands\"|木遁・剛力千手|Mokuton: Gōriki Senju}}. Also, through his Several Thousand Hands, his fists can break off and rain down like meteors onto the target.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Golpeo de la Cumbre]]\n[[fr:Transfiguration Suprême]]\n[[pt-br:Buddha Superiormente Transformado]]\n[[pl:Chōjō Kebutsu]]"
