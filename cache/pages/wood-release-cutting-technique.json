It involves cutting off a piece of a plant, usually the stem or root, which is then put in an appropriate medium. If done properly, the cut piece will grow into a new plant, genetically identical to the plant it was cut from.\n* When this technique was first performed by Obito, various [[black receiver]]s were scattered throughout the growth of branches that extended from his right side. However, upon deactivating his [[Mangekyō Sharingan]] and the Wood Release Technique, the rods vanished with them.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Mokuton - Technique de la Lance Rhizomique]]\n[[pl:Mokuton: Sashiki no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Madeira: Técnica Cortante]]"
