Anyone who comes in contact with the gas gets paralysed for a short while. Furthermore, the technique can hinder the sense of smell of their victims for a prolonged period of time, as seen with [[Kiba Inuzuka]] and [[Akamaru]]. Due to this, this technique is very effective against [[ninken]] and other [[Inuzuka Clan|groups]] who rely on their sense of smell. The smell is due to fermentation inside the body.\n\n[[pl:Sumerudama]]"
