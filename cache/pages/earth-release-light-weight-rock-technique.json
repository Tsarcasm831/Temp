The atmosphere, along with their body, can be lightened in order to take flight and increasing their manoeuvrability. With enough practice, the user can control their flight through the sky with specific bodily movements. However, a consequence of using this technique on oneself or another individual is a decrease in the physical force of the affected person's attacks.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 513, page 4</ref>\n\nŌnoki, who possessed a mastery over this technique, was able to also manipulate the weight of other targets. By touching his target, he could instead take their gravity away and regulate just how much is taken.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 513, page 1</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The usage of this technique to fly is apparently well-known amongst the [[Tsuchikage]], as [[Madara Uchiha]] immediately recognised its usage by Ōnoki.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 561, page 2</ref>\n* [[Pain]], [[Obito]]<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 348</ref> and [[Madara Uchiha]]<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 362</ref> have all demonstrated the ability to levitate, though it's not clear if this technique was responsible for the feat. Although, all of them did have mastery over Earth Release at the time.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Six Paths Senjutsu]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Jutsu de Roca Ligera]]\n[[fr:Doton - Roches Lourdes et Roches Légères]]\n[[pl:Doton: Keijūgan no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Terra: Técnica da Rocha Leve]]"
