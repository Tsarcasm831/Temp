When the sphere is activated, it generates powerful attractive force, pulling everything in the vicinity to it until a large [[Wikipedia:Natural satellite|satellite]] is created;<ref name=\"c439\">''Naruto'' chapter 439, pages 1-7</ref> users control how large the satellite becomes.<ref name=\"c440\">''Naruto'' chapter 440, page 2</ref> Creating a satellite apparently requires a great deal of [[chakra]], such that [[Nagato]], when attempting to use it through his [[Six Paths of Pain]], must first bring the Deva Path close to his location so that he can channel his chakra to it more effectively, although it was done in his heavily exhausted state.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 438, page 17</ref>\n\nChibaku Tensei is most often used to restrain targets, drawing them in during the satellite's creation and trapping them beneath the mounds of rubble.<ref name=\"c439\"/> When used to capture tailed beasts, the resulting satellites are known as {{translation|\"Tailed Beast Sealing Stones\"|尾獣封印の岩|Bijū Fūin no Iwa}}.<ref>''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]''</ref> Only [[Naruto Uzumaki]], by entering a near-[[Tailed Beast Mode]], has been known to break free from one.<ref name=\"c440\"/> Because of how difficult it is to escape from Chibaku Tensei, the best way to counter it is to destroy the black sphere early on in the formation process. In order to penetrate the initial layers of rubble, users should use their most powerful attacks, such as the [[Tailed Beast Ball]] or [[Wind Release: Rasenshuriken]]. Actually aiming at the black sphere is not really necessary, as all attacks will be pulled towards it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 551, pages 12-15</ref>\n\n[[File:Sasuke traps the Tailed Beasts.png|thumb|left|Sasuke's multiple Chibaku Tensei.]]\nWhen performed by Sasuke Uchiha, he does not use the typical black sphere, instead gathering rubble around each of his [[Genjutsu: Sharingan|immobilised]] targets;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 692, pages 14-15</ref> this is similar to the [[Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei]]. Once the satellites are formed, Sasuke is able to move them remotely.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 696, page 5</ref> [[Madara Uchiha]] is also shown creating multiple satellites at a time, each with its own black sphere. Rather than use the satellites to restrain targets, Madara uses them as large projectiles that he drops on his opponents.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 676, pages 9-11</ref>\n\n== Video Games ==\nChibaku Tensei is a common move in ''Naruto'' video games:\n*In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble]]'', Pain generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor. In the game it is called \"[[Six Paths Technique]]\" rather than Chibaku Tensei. An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called {{translation|\"Six Paths Technique: Collapse\"|六道の術・崩壊|Rikudō no Jutsu: Hōkai}} can also be performed.\n*In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 2]]'', Pain uses Chibaku Tensei to summon a whirlwind of boulders to protect himself against attacks. He can also launch the boulders individually as a form of attack.\n*In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Impact]]'', Pain creates the planetary body and brings it down on his opponents. He also uses this as his Awakening, where he summons a whirlwind of boulders as a defensive system and an offensive system at the same time.\n*In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'', Nagato uses this technique to imprison his opponent, and then fires a [[Asura Attack|chakra blast]] which goes through its core, causing a massive explosion.\n*In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]'', as part of Pain and [[Konan]]'s [[Fiery Paper Star of God|collaboration]], Pain uses this technique to trap his opponent and then Konan lines the debris with [[explosive tags]]. Konan then sends a single origami bird which causes a massive explosion.\n*In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', [[Rinnegan]] Sasuke pierces the opponent with the [[Kagutsuchi|black flames]], traps him within Chibaku Tensei, and then [[Takemikazuchi|destroys it with Chidori Kagutsuchi]] via his [[Complete Body — Susanoo]]. His ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie|The Last]]'' version also uses the technique as part of his [[Chidori: Star Crusher]]. And during the boss battle against Naruto and Sasuke, Madara is able to create a gargantuan version of Chibaku Tensei by merging multiple planetoids into one with the [[Wood Release]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite Madara using this technique in the manga, he is not listed as a user in ''[[Jin no Sho]]''.<ref name=\"d4\"/>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Banshō Ten'in]]\n* [[Shinra Tensei]]\n* [[Tengai Shinsei]]\n* [[True: Chibaku Tensei]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Chibaku Tensei (Jutsu)]]\n[[ka:ჩიბაკუ ტენსეი]]\n[[ru:Чибаку Тенсей]]\n[[it:{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[id:Chibaku Tensei]]\n[[fr:Chibaku Tensei]]\n[[pl:Chibaku Tensei]]"
