It would appear to be a complex sealing technique, given the many sealing formulas in surrounding sealing room, as well as a rather large tablet, which is actually used to restrain the beast. \n\nThe exact mechanics of this technique are unknown, however, after the Zero-Tails was sealed, the beast became encased in a tan coloured cocoon-like structure, with the addition of several tubular attachments, which allow the beast to channel its dark chakra through the Ancor Vantian. The technique also acts to protect the Zero-Tails by absorbing any chakra from external sources which pose a threat.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Even restrained, the Zero-Tails is still capable of manifesting itself, and using its abilities.\n* In ''[[Naruto Mobile]]'', Zero-Tails himself is able to use this technique to \"freeze\" an opponent for 15 seconds and attack them without hindrance.\n\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Selamento do Zero-Caudas]]\n[[pl:Technika Pieczętująca Zeroogoniastego]]"
