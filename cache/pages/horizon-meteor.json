Then, several platforms, alongside the opponent, are lifted into the air, with the user creating an [[Limbo: Border Jail|invisible clone]] to strike the opponent hard enough to blow them onto another floating platform. After that, four more invisible clones are created, which punch the opponent with force enough to send them straight into the ground.
