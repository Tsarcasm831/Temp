It attempts to use the [[Rasengan]]'s form to create a substitute for the [[Tailed Beast Ball]].\n\n== Background ==\nTo get around the fact that he could not originally use either the Tailed Beast Ball or [[Shadow Clone Technique]] while in [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode]], [[Killer B]] advised Naruto to use his [[Tailed Beast Chakra Arms|chakra arms]] instead to attempt to create a Rasengan. \n\nAt the start of his training, Naruto finds some difficulty making the ratio of black and white [[chakra]] 8:2. Despite the fact that Naruto was in his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he still sustained injuries on his hand when practising the technique. Naruto asks Killer B to watch and tell him when he has got the ratio right so he can remember the feel of the technique. Naruto has also noted that this new Rasengan is quite heavy, as he can barely hold it up. This is likely because of the Nine-Tails' chakra, which has been described as very dense in previous instances.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 295, page 5</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 504, page 6</ref> According to Killer B, he has almost perfected it, and the best way to learn and master it was from real-life experience on the battlefield.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 529, page 1</ref> Later, during the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], after gaining [[Kurama]]'s cooperation, Naruto gained the ability to use the Tailed Beast Ball, and subsequently, developed the [[Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball]], leaving the completion of this technique unnecessary.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 595, pages 4-6</ref>\n \n== Trivia ==\n* The positive and negative chakra are coloured differently in the anime, with red for negative and blue for positive.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 264</ref>\n* In the anime-exclusive [[Power (Arc)|Power arc]], Naruto managed to create an incomplete yet effective Tailed Beast Rasengan (before he had absolute control of the Nine-Tails' chakra) which was able to petrify his [[Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone|Nine-Tailed clone]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 295</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball]]\n* [[Tailed Beast Ball]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[id:Rasengan Monster Berekor]]\n[[fr:Orbe Tourbillonnant des Démons à Queues]]\n[[pl:Bijū Rasengan]]\n[[pt-br:Rasengan da Bijū]]\n[[ru:Расенган Хвостатого Зверя]]"
