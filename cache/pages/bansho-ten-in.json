It has the same five second limit as the Shinra Tensei as stated by [[Chōji Akimichi]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 427, page 8</ref> The area of effect can be localised, so it is possible to selectively attract a target or targets without affecting the object or the structure they're connected to.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 423, page 15-16</ref><ref name=\"c549\">''Naruto'' chapter 549, pages 9-10</ref> It is also possible to attract multiple targets at once, causing them to collide with each other.<ref name=\"c549\"/> The ability to manipulate attractive forces with this technique is granted by the [[Deva Path]] much like its counterpart [[Shinra Tensei]].\n\n== Other Media ==\nAn enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of Banshō Ten'in appears in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble]]'', called {{translation|\"Banshō Ten'in: Dōmetsu\"|万象天引・導滅|lit meaning=Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Guiding Destruction}}.\n\nIn ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact]]'', Nagato can also use it to lift the ground and throw it at the opponent, called {{translation|\"Banshō Ten'in: Jidō\"|万象天引・地動|lit meaning=Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Ground Motion}}.\n\n== Influence ==\nThe names of Banshō Ten'in and its companion ability, [[Shinra Tensei]], are derived from {{translation|''Shinra Banshō''|神羅万象|lit meaning=Everything Covered by God}}, a Japanese [[Wikipedia:Yojijukugo|four-character idiom]] and homophone variant of {{translation|''Shinra Banshō''|森羅万象|lit meaning=All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things}}, a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All Nature\" or \"All Creation\".\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'', Nagato and Madara pull their opponent through a black sphere like [[Chibaku Tensei]].\n* Sasuke Uchiha uses a technique to summon the sealed [[Tailed Beast]]s near the [[God Tree]]'s stump to where he was above the [[Valley of the End]] near him, which may have been this technique or a variant of it.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Chibaku Tensei]]\n* [[Shinra Tensei]]\n* [[Tengai Shinsei]]\n* [[True: Chibaku Tensei]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bansho Ten'in}}\n__NOTOC__\n\n[[es:Banshō Ten'in]]\n[[fr:Banshô Ten'in]]\n[[ka:ბანშო თენინ]]\n[[id:Banshō Ten'in]]\n[[pl:Banshō Ten'in]]"
