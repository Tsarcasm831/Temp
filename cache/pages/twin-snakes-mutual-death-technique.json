The user grabs one of their intended victim's hands and forces it to assist in performing the necessary [[hand seal]]s. Once this is done, the user and the victim die, which ''[[Rin no Sho]]'' likens to a lovers' double-suicide.<ref name=\"d1\"/> It's not actually clear how death occurs because the technique has never been seen performed successfully: when Anko uses it on Orochimaru, she stabs his hand to hers to prevent him from escaping as she performs the hand seals. When she realises he's merely a [[shadow clone]], the technique is aborted.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 50</ref> ''[[Naruto: One Decade, One Hundred Ninja]]'' illustrates this technique as two [[snake]]s coiling around Anko and Orochimaru.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3]]'' and its sequels, when Anko performs this technique, two summoned snakes wrap themselves around her and her opponent. The snakes lock themselves together by biting each others' necks and then detonate. For gameplay reasons, Anko is left unharmed. \n** This technique also activates Anko's [[Cursed Seal of Heaven]], but only if it's used against Orochimaru.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu de Sacrificio de Serpientes Gemelas]]\n[[fr:Double Mort des Serpents]]\n[[pl:Sōjasōsai no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica da Morte Mútua das Cobras Gêmeas]]"
