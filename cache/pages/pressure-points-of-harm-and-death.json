This allows the use of taxing techniques such as [[Crystal Release: String of Glory]]. The amount of chakra released is so much that it becomes visible and causes water to form a vortex around her, similar to the one caused by opening the \"Sixth Gate of Joy\" from the [[Eight Gates]]. Her eyes also turn completely white momentarily.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Antlion Ninja Arts: Ephemeral]]\n* [[Eight Gates]]\n* [[Seven Heavens Breathing Method]] \n* [[Bando's Chakra Armour]] \n\n[[es:Puntos de Presión: Daño y Muerte]]\n[[pt-br:Pontos de Pressão de Dor e Morte]]\n[[pl:Shishō Tenketsu]]"
