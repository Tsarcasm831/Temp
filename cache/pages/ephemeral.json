When the technique was used on [[Naruto Uzumaki]], crows flocked from Itachi and turned into [[shuriken]] after he performed the ram [[Hand Seal|seal]] which bombarded Naruto, and then attempted to put him to sleep. When he resisted the sleep command, Naruto then experienced the sensation of his body parts turning into his closest friends who then tortured him psychologically. This is implied to be an extra stage of the genjutsu caused by Itachi after performing the ram seal. The same goes along with his use of shuriken.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This genjutsu is never named in the anime, manga, or manga databooks. It is instead given a name in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX]]''. These video game variations only consist of the damage caused by the crow-turned-shuriken, with Itachi finishing his foe off with a sword slash.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4]]'', this technique is called \"Genjutsu: Bubbles\". This may be an allusion to the impermanence of bubbles and \"Ephemeral\" literally meaning something akin to \"for a moment\" or a short while, \"bubbles\" also being a translation for the technique's name, making use of wordplay.\n\n[[es:Efimero]]\n[[fr:Éphémère]]\n[[pl:Utakata (jutsu)]]"
