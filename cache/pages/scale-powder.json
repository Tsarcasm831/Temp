According to old wives' tales, that dust causes blindness.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'' and ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]'', the powder appears to be orange as well as [[Scale Powder Blasting|combustible]], while in the anime, it is bright white. They are also an ability of Chōmei's, while in the manga, that is unconfirmed.\n* In the anime, the [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]] version of [[Chōmei]] in [[B]]'s dream is able to use this technique.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 430</ref>\n* In the anime and video games, this technique was shown to be an offensive one causing damage to the opponent, however this was not indicated in the manga.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Poudre d'Écaille]]\n[[pl:Rinpun]]"
