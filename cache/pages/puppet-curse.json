It can be activated long after the technique is first applied. The appearance is a red eye with another circle in it resembling the pupil, with four lines stemming from the upper line of the eye and two big thick lines stemming from the side of the eye. This power seems to control the minds of others as it appeared on [[Kakashi Hatake]]'s forehead, vanished, then took control over his body. The eyes of the person who get caught by this technique turn red while they are being controlled.\n\nThe technique works in a manner similar to controlling a puppet; using hand motions to guide the target to its destination.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While it is unnamed in the movie, it is named in ''[[Naruto Mobile]]''.\n\n[[es:Maldición de Marioneta]]\n[[fr:Malédiction des marionnettes]]\n[[ru:Проклятие Марионетки]]\n[[pt-br:Maldição da Marionete]]"
