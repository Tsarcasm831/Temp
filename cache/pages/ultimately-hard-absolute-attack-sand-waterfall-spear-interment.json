He then summons a large amount of [[sand]] in the form of Ultimately Hard Absolute Attack: Spear of Shukaku, which he then sends towards the giant mound of sand at intense speed, aimed at the opponent. Due to the size of the spear, it rips the enemy apart, killing them and causing the mound to explode.\n\n[[pt-br:Supremo Ataque Absoluto: Enterro de Areia]]"
