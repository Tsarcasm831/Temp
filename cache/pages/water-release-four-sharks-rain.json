This water then forms into a group of four [[Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique|water sharks]], which then rush towards the target from above. Should these sharks be attacked, the water that composes them simply reforms into countless droplet-sized sharks, which continue to rain down upon the target and inflict damage whenever they come into contact with them.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique's name is likely a reference to {{translation|\"Ameshikō\"|雨四光}}, a high-scoring hand in [[wikipedia:Hanafuda|hanafuda]] involving one rain card and three bright non-rain cards.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Water Release: Infinite Sharks]]\n\n[[pl:Suiton: Ameshikō]]"
