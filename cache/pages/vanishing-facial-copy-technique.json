Because it's the actual face that they're using and not a disguise, the user runs no risk of being discovered due to imperfections or minor flaws. The bodies of those whose faces have been stolen are, as a consequence, quite ghastly to look upon.<ref name=\"d1\"/> After [[Orochimaru]] uses this technique to take the face of a [[Kusagakure]]-nin, his voice changes as well, though it's not clear if that's part of this technique. As he takes damage in combat, the stolen face gradually wrinkles before finally tearing away, revealing Orochimaru's face underneath.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 49</ref> Orochimaru can also remove the face himself when he no longer needs it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 115</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique is reminiscent of the [[Wikipedia:Noppera-bō|Noppera-bō]], a ghost from Japanese folklore that resembles a human with no face.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Technique d'Effacement et Copie du Visage]]\n[[pl:Shōshagan no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica da Cópia Facial Extinguível]]"
