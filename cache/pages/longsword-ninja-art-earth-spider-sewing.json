Once a person stumbles into the area, they pull the string to trap their feet in a formation of wire, cutting them off. The power and force behind the wires can be controlled by the user by applying additional strength. \n\n[[Kakashi]] was able to counter the technique by landing atop the wires instead of between them. [[Might Guy]] was also able to counter the technique by using a [[kunai]] to stop the wires from converging. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* The [[Wikipedia:Atypus karschi|''Atypus karschi'']] spider, known in Japan as {{translation|\"Jigumo\"|地蜘蛛|Jigumo|lit meaning=Earth Spider}}, hunts with an unusual tube-shaped web, which is partially hidden underground. When a prey lands on it, the spider bites through the silk.\n\n[[es:Jutsu de la Espada Larga: Telaraña de Araña de Tierra]]"
