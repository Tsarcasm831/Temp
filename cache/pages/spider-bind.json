On contact, the web pushes targets away from Kidōmaru and wraps around them, trapping them. Because Kidōmaru's threads are made sticky with [[chakra]], escaping from them is difficult once trapped. Kidōmaru most often uses this technique in response to frontal attacks, the webs neutralising his opponents before they can harm him.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Toile d'Araignée]]\n[[pl:Kumo Shibari]]\n[[pt-br:Aprisionamento Aracnídeo]]"
