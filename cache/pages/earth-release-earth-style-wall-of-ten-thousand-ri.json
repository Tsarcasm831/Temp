These grow upwards from the ground and together, form a hard, defensive wall.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* A {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Li (unit)|ri]]|里}} is an old unit of distance. It used to be about half a kilometre — and still is in China, where it is called a lǐ — but elongated over time until it was fixed on 3927.27 metres during the Meiji period (1868–1912). A thousand ri is used as a general measurement for a very long distance. Ten thousand ri would be a step beyond even that. There is a well-known saying by the famous Chinese philosopher [[Wikipedia:Laozi|Lǎozǐ]] that goes, {{translation|\"a journey of a thousand lǐ begins with a single step\"|千里之行，始于足下|Qiān lǐ zhī xíng, shǐ yú zú xià}}.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Estilo Pared de Tierra de los Diez Mil Ri]]\n[[fr:Doton - Grande Muraille de Terre]]\n[[pl:Doton: Banri Doryūheki]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Terra: Parede de Lama de Dez Mil Ri]]"
