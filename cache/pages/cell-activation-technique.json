This causes their body to start repairing itself while the [[medical-nin]] is operating; restoring damaged tissues and bone structures while healing the patient during more invasive and delicate procedures. With this technique, Tsunade was able to increase [[Rock Lee]]'s surgery success rate from 50% to 58%.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Body Revival Technique]]\n* [[Creation Rebirth]]\n\n[[fr:Formation du Hakke Mécanique]]\n[[pl:Saibō no Kasseijutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Estimulação das Células]]"
