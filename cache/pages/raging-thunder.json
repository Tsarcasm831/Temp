This technique was used in an attempt to negate [[Naruto]]'s [[Rasengan]]. The two attacks resulted in a massive explosion that destroyed the mountain peak that Naruto and Temujin were fighting on.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although the Japanese subtitle of this technique is written in kanji, it is pronounced in English, {{Translation|\"Raging Thunder\"|ライジングサンダー|Reijingu Sandā}}. The Japanese pronunciation of the kanji would be ''Madō Shōraigeki'', which would literally translate to \"Magic Rising Lightning Strike\".\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Tonnerre Enragé]]\n[[pl:Reijingu Sandā]]"
