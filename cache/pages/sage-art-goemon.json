Within an instant, that area will be filled with oil burning at temperatures of thousands of degrees. The superheated oil creates an inferno of such magnitude that, within an instant, the target and the surrounding area will be reduced to cinders.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* \"Goemon\" comes from the legendary sixteenth-century ninja {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Ishikawa Goemon|Ishikawa Goemon]]|石川五右衛門}} who was boiled alive in oil after a failed assassination attempt on the daimyō {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]|豊臣秀吉}}.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]'', the name that appears when Jiraiya uses this technique adds {{translation|\"bath\"|風呂|furo}}, although he doesn't say it.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet]]\n* [[Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet]]\n* [[Goemon Hellfire]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Senpô - Goemon]]\n[[pt-br:Arte Sábia: Goemon]]\n[[pl:Senpō: Goemon]]"
