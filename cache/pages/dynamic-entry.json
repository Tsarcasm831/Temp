The kick serves two simultaneous purposes: as a surprise attack,<ref name=\"d2\"/> for which reason the user may first throw a [[kunai]] to distract targets from the approaching kick;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 148</ref> as an act of self-sacrifice, with the user's exaggerated stance, confident expression, and the sheer inconceivableness of the attack combining to intimidate the opponent, in the process enhancing the kick's offensive potential. Because the kick's effectiveness very much relies on appearance, any faltering of resolve will weaken it: when [[Might Guy]] realizes mid-flight that he's attacking [[Jiraiya]], an ally, his surprise causes his kick to do less damage than it otherwise would have.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Entrada Dinámica]]\n[[fr:Irruption Fracassante]]\n[[pl:Dainamikku Entorī]]\n[[pt-br:Entrada Dinâmica]]\n[[sr:Динамични улаз]]"
