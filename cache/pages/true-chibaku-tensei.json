The black sphere will then expand and encase a large area. Upon which, it draws in a large quantity of the earth around, effectively creating a \"moon\" that hovers high in the sky with the consumed area inside. Slowly after, the structure will begin compressing itself, crushing everything within. The structure is very powerful as even an [[Eight Gates]]-enhanced attack could barely scathe its surfaces. By performing a Snake handseal, the technique can be released, safely returning the entrapped area back to its proper location.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* A version of [[Nagato]] within Jiraiya's novel within Tsunade's [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]] dream performed this technique.\n* As shown when Nagato also performed the standard [[Chibaku Tensei]] next to it, this variation is vastly larger in comparison.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Banshō Ten'in]]\n* [[Chibaku Tensei]]\n* [[Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei]]\n* [[Tengai Shinsei]]\n\n[[pt-br:Verdadeiro: Chibaku Tensei]]\n[[pl:Shin: Chibaku Tensei]]"
