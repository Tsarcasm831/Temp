However, the true purpose of the exercise is actually to hone the individual's concentration and to keep their mind from becoming distracted. As explained by [[Iruka Umino]], only those who have worked hard on their ability to concentrate can become excellent [[shinobi]]. For generations [[Konoha]] ninja have practised using this method in order to better their mental focus. The leaf emblem on the Konoha [[forehead protector]] is said to originate from this training.<ref name=\"Chpt154\">''Naruto'' chapter 154, pages 7-10</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While trying to master the [[Rasengan]], Naruto thinks back to this lesson, and uses Iruka's advice to complete the second stage of the [[ninjutsu]].<ref name=\"Chpt154\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:El punto de enfoque: La marca de la Hoja]]\n[[fr:Entraînement de Concentration de la Feuille]]\n[[pl:Ćwiczenia Koncentracji na Liściu]]"
