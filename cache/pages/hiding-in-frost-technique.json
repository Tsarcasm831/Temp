The frost allows the user to become transparent within it. Upon being struck with an attack, the user becomes visible. The mist is visible to the naked eye, but since the user is transparent it voids that sense. An effective way of finding the user is tracking them through sound.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite frost being the frozen deposition of water vapour, it is not completely clear whether or not this technique involves [[Ice Release]] or is just another form of Water Release, due to the anime's tendency of incorporating ice-producing Water Release techniques.\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Ocultación en el Frío]]\n[[fr:Camouflage dans le Gel]]\n[[pl:Shimogakure no Jutsu]]"
