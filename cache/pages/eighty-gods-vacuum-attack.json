This technique can be used both offensively and defensively. Combined with her [[Byakugan]], this ability has the potential to wreak havoc on the battlefield and is considered the strongest offensive ability.

The speed of this attack leaves no room for her target to escape.<section end=summary />\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name of this technique may find its roots in a Japanese folk tale, known as the [[wikipedia:Hare of Inaba|Hare of Inaba]].
