Because of how quickly the bones appear from the ground, how wide an area they cover, and how high into the air they extend, this technique can do extensive amounts of damage, killing indiscriminately. If any of his targets should somehow avoid this technique, Kimimaro, by activating the second level of his [[Cursed Seal of Earth|cursed seal]], is able to merge with the bone blades. He can then appear from any of them, ideally, one at the target's blindspot so that he can launch a finishing attack.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nAfter acquiring Kimimaro's DNA, [[Kabuto Yakushi]] is able to use this technique through his [[Strange Transmission Distant Shadow]] technique; he produces a clone of Kimimaro, which places its hands on the ground to create the sprouting bone blades.<ref name=\"ch585\">''Naruto'' chapter 585, page 6</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When Kabuto uses this technique, he refers to it as {{translation|\"Kimimaro: Shikotsumyaku: Dance of the Seedling Fern\"|君麻呂・屍骨脈・早蕨の舞|Kimimaro: Shikotsumyaku: Sawarabi no Mai}}.<ref name=\"ch585\"/>\n* A [[wikipedia:fern|fern]], when first sprouted, is a mere bud, but at maturity can grow to heights greater than two meters.<ref>''[[Tō no Sho]]'', page 207</ref>\n* This is the only known [[Shikotsumyaku]] technique to be classified as [[ninjutsu]], rather than [[taijutsu]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Danza del Helecho]]\n[[fr:Danse des Jeunes Fougères Arborescentes]]\n[[pl:Sawarabi no Mai]]"
