Thousands of hands originate from the statue's back in countless concentric rows, while its two main hands are clasped, as if in prayer. The statue can serve a variety of purposes in battle, from fighting on the user's behalf to defending and even using [[Top Transformed Buddha|other techniques]]. The sheer size of this technique makes it almost impossible to attack the user.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 621, pages 12-14</ref>\n\nIt can also detach its main self from its main arsenal to increase its mobility to adapt to a situation that requires more speed. With its immense strength, it can grab hold of a [[tailed beast]] with ease and hold it in place, leaving it unable to move. Hashirama can then use the [[Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands]] in conjunction with the [[Wood Release: Wood Human Technique|Wood Human]] on the statue's head to suppress and remove any direct [[Tailed Beast Control|control]] over the tailed beast.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 626, pages 4-7</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThis technique seems to be influenced by the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion, [[Wikipedia:Avalokiteśvara|Avalokiteśvara]], also known as {{translation|\"Senju Kannon\"|千手観音|lit meaning=Thousand-Armed Kannon}}.\n\nOne prominent story tells of Kannon vowing never to rest until he had freed all beings from [[Wikipedia:Saṃsāra|Saṃsāra]]. After strenuous effort, but struggling to comprehend the needs of so many who still had yet to be saved, his head splits into eleven pieces. The Buddha [[Wikipedia:Amitābha|Amida]], seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering. Upon hearing and comprehending these cries, Kannon attempted to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amida comes to his aid and grants him a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When used by Hashirama, the creatures created through the [[Wood Release: Wood Human Technique]] and the [[Wood Release: Wood Dragon Technique]] sit atop the head of the wooden statue.\n* In ''[[Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections]]'', Asura's usage of the jutsu has the statue firing a large [[Amenomihashira]] at the opponent.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Arte Sabio: Elemento Madera: Diez Mil Manos]]\n[[fr:Senpô - Mokuton - Mille Mains Véritables]]\n[[id:Teknik_Petapa_Elemen_Kayu:_Beberapa_Ribu_Tangan_Sesungguhnya]]\n[[pl:Senpō Mokuton: Shin Sūsenju]]\n[[pt-br:As Verdadeiras Mil Mãos]]"
