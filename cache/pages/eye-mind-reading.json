The user is also able to perform this on themself to dive deeply into their own memories and restore or remove information in their own mind and others. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* While he was not actually seen using it, Hanare offered to let [[Kakashi]] use it on her to see if she was telling the truth.\n\n[[es:Ojo de Lectura de Mente]]\n[[pl:Czytanie Umysłu Okiem]]\n[[fr:Œil de Lecture d'Esprit]]"
