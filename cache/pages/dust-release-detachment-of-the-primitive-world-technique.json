The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines. The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust. Because it attacks at a molecular level, there is no conventional defence against this technique.<ref name=\"d4\"/> The technique isn't limited to just affecting physical matter; it can also affect [[chakra]]-based defences, witnessed from [[Ōnoki]]'s use of it to destroy [[Madara Uchiha]]'s [[Susanoo]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 575, pages 10-11</ref>\n\n[[File:Kako's Dust Release.png|thumb|left|Kakō's large variant.]]\nThe resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure. For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage. However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an [[Island Turtle|entire island]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 514, pages 1-2</ref> Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad [[Multiple Wood Release Clone Technique|wood clones]] in an instant. This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 588, pages 14-15</ref> When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.<ref name=\"C546P14\">''Naruto'' chapter 546, pages 14-16</ref>\n\n[[Kakō]] has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).<ref>''Boruto'' episode 87</ref>\n\n== Shape Variants ==\nThis technique can be [[Shape Transformation|manipulated]] into a diverse selection of three-dimensional structures, including cones, cylinders and cubes, with each retaining a sphere located at their centres. The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it. According to Ōnoki, the differences in shape demonstrated by the users of this technique is reflective of the generational gap between them.<ref name=\"C546P14\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"160\" captionalign=\"center\" orientation=\"square\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nDust Release.png|Cubical variant.\nCone dust release.png|{{translation|Drill|錐|Kiri}}<ref name=\"Revolution\">''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution''</ref> variant.\nMu using Jinton.png|{{translation|Cylinder|柱|Chū}}<ref name=\"Revolution\"/> variant.\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Polvo: Jutsu del Desprendimiento del Mundo Primitivo]]\n[[fr:Jinton - Détachement du Monde Primitif]]\n[[pl:Jinton: Genkai Hakuri no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Pó: Técnica do Desprendimento do Mundo Primitivo]]"
