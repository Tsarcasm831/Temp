Naruto and eight of his [[shadow clone]]s each form a [[Rasenshuriken]] that's been imbued with the unique [[chakra]] of a different [[tailed beast]]; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]] would be weak to.<ref name=\"d4\"/> When the nine thrown Rasenshuriken strike Kaguya, multiple large explosions are created. Although Kaguya herself is not noticeably hurt by the attack, the tailed beasts' chakra contained within the Rasenshuriken resonates with the tailed beasts' chakra within Kaguya, preventing her from maintaining her humanoid form.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 688</ref> ''[[Jin no Sho]]'' describes this as, \"the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time.\"<ref name=\"d4\"/>\n\nThe exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Shukaku]] has a similar appearance to the [[Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan]], which uses [[magnet]]ized [[sand]].\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Matatabi]] appears to consist of the same blue [[fire]] that Matatabi's body is composed of.\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Isobu]] is seemingly formed out of [[water]].\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Son Gokū]] appears to be the [[Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken]].\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Kokuō]] seems to be emitting [[boil|steam]], which [[Han|Kokuō's jinchūriki]] have been shown to be able to produce.\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Saiken]] resembles a bubbly gas. In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for [[Wisdom Wolf Decay]]. In the anime, it appears more analogous to the [[Soap Bubble Ninjutsu]] used by [[Utakata|Saiken's jinchūriki]].\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Chōmei]] has no obvious source in either the manga or anime. ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'' identifies it as being composed of [[Scale Powder]].\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Gyūki]] is seemingly made of ink, which [[Killer B|Gyūki's jinchūriki]] have been shown to be able to produce.\n#The Rasenshuriken for [[Kurama]] appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''Ultimate Ninja Storm 4'', Naruto can use this technique without [[Six Paths Sage Mode]] to create a single Rasenshuriken: either Shukaku's, Son Gokū's, or Kurama's.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]'', both known variations of the [[Lava Release]] are implied to be present separately within this technique.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Shadow Clone: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[id:Teknik Petapa: Bola Monster Berekor Rasenshuriken Super]]\n[[it:Arte Eremitica: Super Rasenshuriken dei Cercoteri]]\n[[pt-br:Arte Eremita: Super Rasenshuriken das Bijū]]\n[[pl:Senpō: Chō Bijū Rasenshuriken]]\n[[tr:Bilge Sanatı: Kuyruklu Canavar Rasenshurikeni]]\n[[ru:Искусство Мудреца: Супер Расенсюрикен Хвостатого Зверя]]\n[[fr:Senpô - Méga Orbe Shuriken Démoniaque]]"
