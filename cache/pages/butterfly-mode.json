The chakra, when visible, is [[shape]]d into two large butterfly wings that can be compressed into smaller wings. The technique uses an enormous amount of chakra. In this form, the user's combat ability is greatly enhanced; allowing the use of the clan's high-level techniques such as [[Butterfly Bullet Bombing]], and the ability to use the chakra wings to create gusts of chakra.\n\nThere are two methods of entering this mode. The first is through use of the Akimichi's [[Three Coloured Pills]], which aggressively convert all of the user's calories into chakra; if the pills are not regulated properly, the user may die from the rapid weight loss. Practised users are able to convert their calories into chakra on their own through a process known as {{translation|'''Calorie Control'''|カロリーコントロール |Karorī Kontorōru}}; because they are in complete control of how much of their body weight is turned into chakra, it poses less of a risk to the user.\n\nIn the anime, it is shown that using this form without proper control will in fact greatly diminish one's performance.<ref name=\"BE67\">''Boruto'' episode 67</ref> It is also shown that even while in this slim state, the user can still perform various [[Partial Multi-Size Technique|expansion techniques]].<ref name=\"BE156\">''Boruto'' episode 156</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Butterfly Choji Mode}}\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Control de Calorías]]\n[[fr:Mode Papillon]]\n[[pl:Chō Mōdo]]\n[[pt-br:Modo Borboleta]]"
