The three then jump out of the water and strike the opponent behind their back, with Izumo and Kotetsu delivering an attack with a [[Kunai Blade|long kunai]] and a [[Conch Shell Mace|mace]] simultaneously, followed with Asuma striking the opponent with his [[Flying Swallow]]-enhanced [[Chakra Blade]]. After that, Shikamaru uses his [[Shadow Gathering Technique]] to pull his teammates in, allowing Kotetsu and Izumo to attack the opponent once more, creating a pillar of water, which hardens after the blow, followed with Asuma slashing through the pillar and the opponent.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* A jōseki is a term for a well established strategy or tactic in [[wikipedia:shōgi|shōgi]] and [[wikipedia:go (game)|go]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Konoha Joseki Formation}}\n\n[[pt-br:Formação Jōseki de Konoha]]"
