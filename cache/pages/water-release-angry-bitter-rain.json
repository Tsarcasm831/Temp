When the black water falls on a target it clings to their body and covers their eyes, blocking their vision. Because of the name (\"''doku''\" meaning \"poison\"), victims are intended to believe the water is poisonous. In truth the water is harmless, and the name is only meant to distract victims long enough for the user to follow up with another attack and/or escape.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although a novel-only technique, it is similar to [[Amaterasu]] and [[Black Lightning]], as it is also a black-coloured elemental technique.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Water Release: Black Rain Technique]]\n\n[[pt-br:Estilo Água: Chuva Tóxica]]"
