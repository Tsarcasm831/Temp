These sensory capabilities bless Karin with abilities that even surpass [[dōjutsu]] with comparable powers.<ref>''[[Sha no Sho]]'', page 67</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nBy closing her eyes and opening her mind's eye, Karin is able to find and track chakra over a vast distance,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 363, pages 4-5</ref> as well as perceive any unusual chakra activity within a radius of several dozen kilometres. By focusing on a particular target, she can perceive its characteristics, location, and movements with great detail.<ref name=\"d3\"/> She can even deduce its particular [[Nature Transformation|nature]].<ref>Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise Chapter 1</ref> These attributes afford her the ability to perceive fluctuations in a person's chakra made when they are moulding it, lying, or if someone, including herself, is under a [[genjutsu]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 457, page 4</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 477, page 4</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name comes from the word {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Kagura|Kagura]]|神楽|divine entertainment}}, which is a type of Japanese theatrical dance, considered by some to have been developed by the goddess [[Wikipedia:Ame-no-Uzume|Ame-no-Uzume]]. Its roots lie in certain kinds of divination and pacification of the spirits.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Kizuna Drive]]'', Karin's usage of this technique allows her to \"automatically\" dodge any weak attack for a limited period.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Troisième Œil de Kagura]]\n[[es:Ojo de la Mente de Kagura]]\n[[pl:Kagura Shingan]]\n[[pt-br:Olho da Mente de Kagura]]"
