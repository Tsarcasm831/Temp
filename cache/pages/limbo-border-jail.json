Each shadow has the same abilities as the real Madara, with the added advantage of being untrackable.<ref name=\"d4\"/> The shadows can attack targets, giving the appearance of an inexplicable force knocking them down,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 659, pages 12-15</ref> or they can defend Madara, giving the appearance of an invisible wall around him.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 676, page 6</ref> The shadows are invulnerable to any kind of physical damage and cannot be harmed through conventional means.<ref name=\"c674v1\"/> A shadow's very formation can be used defensively, taking Madara's place mid-attack as a sort of [[Body Replacement Technique]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, page 14</ref> After a certain amount of time, a shadow will need to return to Madara's body, and he will likewise need to wait a certain amount of time before he can reform it.<ref name=\"c674v2\">''Naruto'' chapter 674, pages 9-10</ref>\n\nAgainst most opponents, Madara's shadows give him an insurmountable advantage. But [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Sasuke Uchiha]], after receiving [[Six Paths chakra]], undermine some of the shadows' usual benefits: Sasuke can see them with his own Rinnegan; Naruto can [[sense]] them while using [[Six Paths Sage Mode]];<ref name=\"c674v1\"/> Naruto can damage them using [[Six Paths Senjutsu]].<ref name=\"c674v2\"/> Through a combination of these skills, Naruto is able to capture a shadow, preventing it from returning to Madara.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 675, pages 10-11</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Both the first word's [[Wikipedia:Furigana|furigana]] {{translation|''Rinbo''|リンボ}} and the second word {{translation|''Hengoku''|辺獄}} refer to [[Wikipedia:Limbo|Limbo]], with リンボ being the Japanese way of writing Limbo and 辺獄 being an actual translation of the word's meaning.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', Madara's Limbo clones are capable of using [[Susanoo]].\n* Alongside the [[Six Paths Ten-Tails Coffin Seal]], Madara could not use this technique as a [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]] corpse.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Plongée dans les Limbes]]\n[[it:Rinbo: Hengoku]]\n[[pl:Rinbo: Hengoku]]"
