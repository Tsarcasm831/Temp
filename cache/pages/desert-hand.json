The brilliance of this technique is in the strength and sheer size of the constructs which rivals that of a [[tailed beast]]. Once the arms lock onto its target, it is near impossible to break free, and one must resort to other methods. This technique was powerful enough to completely halt the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]]'s [[Demonic Statue Chains|chains]]. \n\nShinki’s usage of this technique incorporates [[Iron Sand]], which he uses to surround his hand to strengthen his punches,<ref>''Boruto'' episode 60</ref> or attach to more Iron Sand to act as arms, that can deliver a barrage of punches.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 59</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the [[Naruto: Shippūden|anime]], this technique was used by Gaara's sand ghost before its proper début.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 186</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Wood Release: Hotei Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Main du Désert]]\n[[pl:Sabaku: Hando]]\n[[pt-br:Deserto: Mão]]"
