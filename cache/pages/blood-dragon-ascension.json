Through this ability, the user forms a dragon of blood with eight heads similar to the \"Yamata no Orochi\", which all have the ability to regenerate. In addition to the regeneration, the heads of the dragon also have the capacity to release steam after biting a target. The dragon formed is strong enough to restrict the movements of [[Sasuke Uchiha]]'s [[Susanoo]] and was able to withstand his [[Lightning Release]], when Chino used it in conjunction with the iron-rich hot-springs of the [[Valley of Hell]], in the [[Land of Hot Water]].  \n\n== Trivia ==\n* The technique appears to be a reference to the Japanese tale of [[wikipedia:Susanoo|Susanoo]] who slew an [[wikipedia:Yamata-no-Orochi|eight-headed dragon]].\n* Unlike its novel counterpart, the blood dragon in the anime didn't seem to possess the ability to regenerate its heads.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 488</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Eight Branches Technique]]\n* [[Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[pt-br:Ketsuryugan: Ascensão do Dragão de Sangue]]"
