By pointing his finger out at a target and writing the proper kanji in the air, this technique produces a variety of effects. \n\n== Known Words ==\nThe effects of these kanji have been shown:\n* 操, which comes from the verb {{translation|操る|ayatsuru}}, meaning \"to manipulate\". This character allows Shiranami to manipulate and control his opponent. The effect manifests when Shiranami writes the kanji in the air at the target's direction; at which point, the kanji appears on the recipient's person. That individual then becomes a subject to Shiranami's will. However, as with the [[Infinite Embrace]], it is not absolute, since a person with tremendous chakra can easily dispel the effect.\n* 滅, which comes from the verb {{translation|滅する|messuru}}, meaning \"to destroy\". Shiranami uses this character to track down and destroy a message sent by carrier pigeon. [[Utakata]] destroyed the word before it could fulfil its purpose.\n* {{translation|岩|iwa|rock}}. This character allows Shiranami to immobilise targets. In the case of [[Shadow Clone Technique|clones]], this dispels them.\n* {{translation|爆|baku|explode}}. This character causes several explosions that can also be used to dispel clones.\n* {{translation|火|hi|fire}}. This character creates a blaze of fire, which can vary in size.\n* {{translation|炎|en|flames}}. This character creates a large wall of fire to keep the enemies away.\n* {{translation|斬|zan}}, which comes from the verb {{translation|斬る|kiru}}, meaning \"to kill with a blade\". This character creates several blades of wind.\n* {{translation|割|katsu|split}}. This character causes the ground underneath the target to split open.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Super Beast Imitating Drawing]]\n\n[[es:Jibakujutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Restrição do Caractere]]\n[[pl:Jibakujutsu]]"
