The technique can also be used with the help of a [[shadow clone]], though this is not a compulsory component of the technique's execution.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 639, page 13</ref> It should be noted that this technique has never been seen in its entirety.\n\nIn the anime, the usage of the technique was enough to defeat an entire platoon of shinobi. Though it was not seen directly, it produced a lightning flash and repelled the enemies with great force. It also seems to require the kunai to be placed in a circular pattern, a possible reference to its name.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 417</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Tornade d'Éclairs et Danse des Hurlements]]\n[[pl:Rasen Senkō Chō Rinbukō Sanshiki]]\n[[pt-br:Super Flash Espiral da Roda da Dança Uivante da Fórmula Participante Estilo Três]]"
