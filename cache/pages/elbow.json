This technique was strong enough to send [[Jūgo]], who was in his full [[Sage Transformation]], crashing into a wall, disabling him from fighting any further.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 462, page 7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* As with many of the techniques of Fourth Raikage, his brother [[Killer B]]'s [[Lightning Release: Lariat]], and [[Darui]]'s [[Storm Release: Laser Circus]], this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as \"omoryūbaku\", \"jūryūbaku\", \"omoryūbō\", or \"jūryūbō\".\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Elbow]]\n[[pl:Erubō]]"
