The user first wraps ropes around themselves that have [[kunai]] attached to them. Once this is done, they use the [[Multi-Size Technique]] and perform the Human Bullet Tank as normal. The kunai act as spikes, increasing the Bullet Tank's rotation power and, consequently, making it a much more destructive attack.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nChōji's usage of this technique in Part II differs from how he performs it in Part I. Instead of covering himself in kunai, Chōji rapidly grows his hair out to wrap around his body, in a manner similar to [[Jiraiya]]'s [[Needle Jizō]]. This results in far more spikes than the previous version, as well as a shorter preparation time due to Chōji not needing to wrap kunai around his body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 333, page 8</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3]]'', while in his transformed state, [[Hakui]] could use a technique resembling this by rolling into a ball and spinning toward his enemy using his hair as spikes. \n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Shadow Stroke]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Akimichi clan| ]]\n\n[[es:Bola de Tanque Humano Pinchante]]\n[[fr:Boulet Humain Hérissé]]\n[[pl:Nikudan Hari Sensha]]\n[[pt-br:Tanque da Bala Humana Espinhenta]]"
