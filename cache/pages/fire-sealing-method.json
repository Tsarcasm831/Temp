They then activate this technique, quickly sucking any nearby [[Fire Release]] into the blank space and sealing it there, signified by the appearance of the kanji for {{translation|\"seal\"|封}}. Regardless of any special properties that the flames may have, such as those of [[Amaterasu]], they will remain sealed until the user chooses to unseal them. Because this technique is designed for Fire Release, performing it requires expertise in not only using seals but [[ninjutsu]] as well.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Fuuka Houin]]\n[[fr:Emprisonnement du Feu]]\n[[pl:Fūka Hōin]]"
