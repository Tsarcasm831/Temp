Although its most obvious use is as a way of treating external injuries, it can also be used for internal illnesses. Users must be careful to only use as much chakra as is needed for the specific injury. If too much chakra is sent into the body, this can disrupt the body's circulation, putting it into a comatose state.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nBecause of the level of chakra control required to safely use this technique, few [[medical-nin]] can actually perform it;<ref name=\"d1\"/> when [[Sakura Haruno]] is learning how to use it, she's shown practising on a fish.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 238, pages 4-5</ref> When [[Sarada Uchiha]] practised it on a fish, she sent too much chakra and caused it to eventually burn up.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 152</ref> The anime states that the different [[hidden village]]s have all developed their own applications for this technique that are unknown to other villages; in [[Kirigakure]]'s case, its medics can use it as a remedy for seasickness.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 236</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The \"senjutsu\" in this technique's name is unrelated to the [[senjutsu]] used elsewhere in the series. In this technique's case, it is a reference to the secret of immortality the legendary real-life sages allegedly had.\n* This technique is possibly derived from the real-life spiritual practice of [[Wikipedia:Reiki|Reiki]], commonly known as palm- or hands-on-healing.\n* [[Kabuto Yakushi]] has been shown using the Mystical Palm Technique from a short distance away, without directly touching the person he's healing.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 296, pages 12-13</ref>\n** Sakura is likewise shown healing an injury to herself, seemingly without using her hands at all.<ref>''[[Sha no Sho]]'', page 343</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 274, page 4</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Chakra Scalpel]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[da:Shōsen Jutsu]]\n[[de:Shousen Jutsu]]\n[[es:Jutsu: Palma Mística]]\n[[fr:Paume Mystique]]\n[[id:Teknik Tapak Mistik]]\n[[it:Palmo Mistico]]\n[[pl:Shōsen Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica da Palma Mística]]\n[[ru:Техника Мистической Ладони]]\n[[tr:Mistik Avuç Tekniği]]\n[[uk:Чарівнодолонева хірургія]]"
