His body then disappears without warning, leaving behind ten glowing red [[Wikipedia:Orizuru|orizuru]], which slowly float to the ground before fading away. Afterwards, Urashiki's [[chakra]] signature is completely untraceable, allowing him to escape elsewhere unnoticed. The exact nature of this technique is unclear, but upon observing it, [[Sasuke Uchiha]] believed that it does not involve slipping into [[Space–Time Ninjutsu|another dimension]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Body Replacement Technique]]\n* [[Dance of the Shikigami]]"
