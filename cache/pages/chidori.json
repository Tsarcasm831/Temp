Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it's used makes it useful for assassinations.<ref name=\"c113\"/>\n\nThe speed at which the Chidori is performed, despite being one of its greatest assets, also represents one of its biggest drawbacks: the technique makes the users move at their target so fast that its causes a [[wikipedia:tunnel vision|tunnel vision]]-like effect for them. Because they charge in a straight line it is easy for opponents to attack them, and because of the tunnel vision it is difficult for the user to see these attacks, much less react to them. For this reason, most ninja cannot use the Chidori safely.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 240, page 14</ref> However, a user of the [[Sharingan]] can overcome these drawbacks due to its heightened visual perception preventing the tunnel vision from occurring and its predictive capabilities making it easier for the user to avoid counterattacks.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 244, pages 4-6</ref> [[Hidari]] despite having a pair of [[Rinnegan]] finds using the jutsu hard to control, and believes the Sharingan is needed to master it.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 11, page 25</ref> Kakashi's skill with the Chidori eventually became so good that he was able to split a bolt of lightning with it, earning his Chidori the name \"[[Lightning Cutter]]\".<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 114, page 3</ref>\n\nThe Chidori requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, placing a limit on how many times it can be used per day. In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 128, page 11</ref> and [[Sasuke Uchiha]] can use it twice per day under his own power.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 128, page 9</ref> Both increase their limits to an unspecified number in Part II. During Part II, Sasuke demonstrates several variations of the Chidori that have been given [[shape transformation]], such as [[Chidori Senbon]] and [[Chidori Sharp Spear]], both of which allow him to attack at a longer range than the Chidori is capable of.\n\n== Variants ==\nSasuke has been shown using the Chidori with different chakra sources to grant his Chidori additional properties:\n{| class=\"box table coloured bordered innerbordered type-basic\"\n|-\n|[[File:Flapping Chidori.png|center|200x200px]]\n|When drawing on the chakra of his [[Cursed Seal of Heaven]], Sasuke uses a {{translation|\"'''Flapping Chidori'''\"|羽撃く千鳥|Habataku Chidori|lit meaning=Flapping One Thousand Birds|engtv=Black Chidori}},<ref>Second Databook, page 51</ref> which is stronger, darker in colour, and sounds like flapping wings rather than chirping birds.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 232, pages 11-13</ref> Different video games have called it {{translation|\"'''Wailing Chidori'''\"|慟哭の千鳥|Dōkoku no Chidori|''Game translation:'' Chidori Lament|lit meaning=Wailing One Thousand Birds}} and {{translation|\"'''Black Chidori'''\"|黒い千鳥|Kuroi Chidori|lit meaning=Black One Thousand Birds}}. If accessed in his first state of the Cursed Seal, the Chidori is normally coloured purple instead in most forms of media.\n|-\n|[[File:Dark Chidori.png|center|200x200px]]\n|When imbued with the [[Chakra#Six Paths|Six Paths Power]], Sasuke's Chidori can be used to damage the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]], whose body is otherwise impervious to standard ninjutsu.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', this is called {{translation|\"'''Dark Chidori'''\"|黒き千鳥|Kuroki Chidori|''Game translation:'' Onyx Chidori|lit meaning=Dark One Thousand Birds}}.\n|-\n|[[File:Kagutsuchi Chidori.png|center|200x200px]]\n|Sasuke is briefly shown combining Chidori with [[Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 698, page 3</ref> When it is clashed with [[Naruto Uzumaki]]'s Rasengan, the resulting explosion destroys the statues at the [[Valley of the End]] and as well as both of their dominant arms.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 698, page 6</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{Translation|\"Chidori\"|千鳥}} can also be translated to \"[[Wikipedia:Plover|plover]]\".\n* The name Chidori comes from a story about famous samurai [[Wikipedia:Tachibana Dōsetsu|Tachibana Dōsetsu]]: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called {{translation|Chidori|千鳥|lit meaning=A Thousand Birds}}. One day, while he was still a young man, he was taking shelter under a tree, as it was raining. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck him. However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the [[Wikipedia:Raijin|Thunder God]] inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive. After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to {{translation|Raikiri|雷切|lit meaning=Lightning Cutter}}.\n* In the original ''Naruto'' anime, Chidori looks like a white, sphere-shaped amount of electricity that surrounds the palm. This is corrected in the ''Naruto: Shippūden'' anime, where the Chidori is depicted as it is in the manga: a formless coverage of electricity all over the hand.\n** However, in the video game ''J-Stars Victory Vs''. and its ''+'' version, Sasuke's Chidori takes its incorrectly rendered sphere shape as aforementioned, but with the sphere contained within his hand (only during its startup animation and when Sasuke is running with the Chidori active).\n* In both ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2]]'' and ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3|3]]'', players can customise some characters to be able to use Chidori. In the former case, it is called \"Young Lightning\" in the English script when used by Anbu Kakashi.\n** Also, in some forms of media like the aforementioned games (along with ''[[Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4]]'' and ''[[Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2]]''), Sasuke in his Cursed Seal of Heaven state (both level 1 and 2) often has the ability to perform both the normal version of his Chidori and its Cursed Seal version as separate techniques.\n** However, in ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', despite using the Cursed Seal Chidori in his State 2 form for his Battle 7 Koma, Sasuke's Chidori is coloured purple akin to the State 1 version instead of dark-white.\n* In the trailers for ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'', [[Lightning Release Bullet: Powerful Breath]] makes the unique sound that Chidori makes.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Drilling Hand of Sage Lightning]]\n* [[Hell Stab]]\n* [[Lightning Flash Palm]]\n* [[Lightning Release: Purple Electricity]]\n* [[Nadeshiko-Style Hardliner Gale Fist]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Chidori]]\n[[es:Chidori]]\n[[fr:Mille Oiseaux]]\n[[he:צ'ידורי]]\n[[id:Chidori]]\n[[pt-br:Chidori]]\n[[ru:Чидори]]\n[[pl:Chidori]]\n[[tr:Chidori]]"
