However, instead of warping the battlefield into the digestive tracts of a giant [[toad]], Jiraiya reverse summons himself and his opponents into the stomach of a giant toad (possibly the same species as the giant, fire-breathing toad used in his Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind technique), essentially bringing the battle to a new battlefield. \n\nThis technique is also similar to the [[Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison]], which is used to capture and isolate a victim, trapping them inside of a toads stomach, cutting them off from any allies, but also completely immobilising them while the stomach crushes the opponents to death.  \n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Amenominaka]]\n* [[Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind]]\n\n[[fr:Invocation - Concassage de l'Estomac du Crapaud]]"
