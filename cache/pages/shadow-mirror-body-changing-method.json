After performing special hand seals while standing within the prepared area, the technique will activate: ribbons of light extend out from various places on the user's body, covering them completely as they transform the user into what they desire, including any necessary items such as the suitable attire. However, the user's voice does not change.\n\nUnlike a regular [[Transformation Technique|transformation]], this variant is permanent, with purportedly no way for the user to return to their original form.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Substitute Technique]]\n\n[[es:Método: Cambio de Cuerpo del Espejo de Sombra]]\n[[fr:Transformation du Miroir des Ombres]]\n[[pl:Kage Kagami Shinten no Hō]]\n[[pt-br:Método de Mudança Corporal das Sombras Espelhadas]]"
