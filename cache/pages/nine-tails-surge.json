EX 3]]'', this attack could only be performed with a Senzai Ninriki (Latent Ninja Power) active; this is no longer the case in ''Clash of Ninja Revolution 3'' and ''Gekitō Ninja Taisen! Special''.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In some Japanese sources, the naming of this type of attack also applies to Naruto's jumping strong attack in this state as well (which is a burst of energy shot as a projectile downward, but moreso is considered to be a [[Great Roar]] instead).\n* This attack is based off of the invisible surge launched at Sasuke upon Naruto entering his Version 1 form for the first time in the original anime/manga.\n*When used in ''EX 3'', the attack is instead performed with the motion/animation being one of Three-Tailed Naruto's basic attacks.\n**However, as of ''Revolution 3'' and ''Special'', the original animation from ''Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4'' is reused.\n*If the attack is somehow used up close enough in the Wii-subseries, it instead slightly jerks the target back instead of causing them to crumple.\n\n[[es:Oleada de Cuchilladas del Nueve Colas]]\n[[pl:Kyūbi no Hadō]]"
