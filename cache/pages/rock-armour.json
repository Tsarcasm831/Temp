The armour is shown to be able to defend from all forms of blunt-force trauma. At the same time, it enhances the user's strength, allowing them to deliver powerful strikes and break free of restraints. Because this technique works by constantly absorbed earth properties, it requires no extra chakra after initiating it, yet still needs a sufficient amount of stone to be performed. \n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Crystal Armour]]\n* [[Earth Release: Earth Spear]]\n* [[Earth Release: Hardening Technique]]\n\n[[es:Armadura de Roca]]\n[[fr:Armure de Pierre]]\n[[pl:Iwa no Yoroi]]"
