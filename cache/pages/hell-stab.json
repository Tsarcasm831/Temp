By swinging his hand, the Third can create a shock-wave powerful enough to send opponents in the immediate area around him flying back.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 555, page 1</ref>\n* {{translation|'''One-Finger Nukite'''|一本貫手|Ippon Nukite|engtv=One Fingered Assault}}: Thrusting into the target creates what is known as the {{translation|\"''strongest spear''\"|最強の矛|saikyō no hoko|engtv=invincible spear}}, where the concentration of chakra is so great that it extends well beyond the finger in a lone point. It was capable of cutting off all of [[Gyūki]]'s tails at once during an encounter and was even able to pierce the Third's own [[Lightning Release Chakra Mode]], backfiring the damage and scarring his body, which due to his immense durability that was well regarded as the {{translation|\"''strongest shield''\"|最強の盾|saikyō no tate}}.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 555, pages 13-15</ref> Depending on the situation, it can be also be used for vertical cuts, becoming a legendary sword.<ref name=\"d4\" />\n\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" position=\"center\" columns=\"2\" widths=\"250\" hideaddbutton=true>\nJigokuzuki Sanbon.png|The Raikage's Three-Finger Nukite.\nJigokuzuki Ippon.png|The Raikage's One-Finger Nukite.\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* A {{translation|nukite|貫手|lit meaning=crossbeam hand}} is a move used in martial arts like karate, where you strike the opponent with your finger stretched out. A {{translation|four-finger nukite|四本貫手|yonhon nukite}} uses the four fingers and, when aimed at the throat, is called a {{translation|hell stab|地獄突き|jigokuzuki}}. The {{translation|two-finger nukite|二本貫手|nihon nukite}} and {{translation|one-finger nukite|一本貫手|ippon nukite}} are also used. A {{translation|three-finger nukite|三本貫手|sanbon nukite}} seems to be somewhat rare.\n* The [[Fourth Raikage]] used a similar technique in a fight against [[Gyūki]] to cut its horn off.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 494, page 2</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Chidori]]\n* [[Lightning Cutter]]\n* [[Nadeshiko-Style Hardliner Gale Fist]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Puñalada del Infierno]]\n[[fr:Estocade de l'Enfer]]\n[[pl:Jigokuzuki]]\n[[pt-br:Facada Infernal]]"
