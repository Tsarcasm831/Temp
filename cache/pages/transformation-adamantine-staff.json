The staff is as hard as diamond, making it very destructive. This also renders it largely impervious to damage, making it useful as a defence;<ref name=\"d2\"/> despite this, Enma still feels pain from clashing with the [[Sword of Kusanagi (Orochimaru)|Sword of Kusanagi]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 120</ref> The staff is also able to extend to great lengths and/or width,<ref name=\"d2\"/> enough that, in the anime, it could push the [[Nine-Tails]] beyond the borders of [[Konohagakure]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 249</ref> The user can produce any part of his regular body from the staff, such as his claws or fangs, to surprise opponents.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nEnma is shown to [[clone]] himself while in his staff form for use in the [[Adamantine Prison Wall]].[\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The folkloric [[Wikipedia:Sun Wukong|Sun Wukong]] had an extendable staff called [[Wikipedia:Ruyi Jingu Bang|Ruyi Jingu Bang]] (read in Japanese on'yomi as the \"Nyoi Kinko Bō\"). As in the story, Enma's transformation has golden-shaft ends.\n* A ''[[Wikipedia:Ruyi (scepter)|nyoi]]'', which can be translated as ''priest's staff'' but literally means ''as one wishes'', is a decorative object associated with Chinese Buddhist rituals.\n* {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Vajra|Vajra]]|金剛|Kongō}} is a weapon used as a ritual object to symbolise both the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force). In Japanese, the term is also synonymous with [[Wikipedia:adamant|adamantine]].\n** This also references Sun Wukong's staff, which had to be made heavy and durable in order for Wukong to be able to use it (due to other weapons being wielded by him ending up broken).\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n\n[[fr:Transformation - Bâton de la Vérité Bouddhique Indestructible]]\n[[pl:Henge: Kongōnyoi]]"
