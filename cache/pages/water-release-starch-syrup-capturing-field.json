This stream of sticky liquid can be used to form an adhesive trap that will inhibit a person's mobility. One can effectively reduce their enemy's area of activity with this technique, giving the user an advantage on the battlefield. The normal scope of this technique is normally just a few metres, but it is possible to make an entire pond of starch syrup.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 658, page 7</ref> The syrup can be manipulated to move after it is created, being able to stick and travel up surfaces.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 79</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Wikipedia:Mizuame|Mizuame]] is a Japanese sweetener made by converting starch to sugars. It takes the form of a clear, thick, and most of all sticky liquid. It can be literally translated as \"water candy\", emphasising its likeness to water and explaining why it is used in a water release technique.\n* In an [[Omake#New Technique|omake]], it is shown that this technique's creation was inspired when Izumo knocked over a jar of syrup, which was previously being eaten plain by [[Kotetsu Hagane]], and subsequently tripped in the sticky substance.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Starch Syrup Gun]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[he:ג'וטסו כדור האש]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Água: Captura do Campo de Xarope de Amido]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Mizuame Nabara]]\n[[fr:Suiton - Mare de Mucus]]"
