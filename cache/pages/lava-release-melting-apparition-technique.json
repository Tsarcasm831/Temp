Mei changes chakra inside her body into a powerful acidic fluid that will melt anything and spits out the viscous fluid from her mouth. Both the shape and the amount are determined by her. By spitting it out at short-range the technique's speed increases. By distributing the liquid across a vast range, she creates an acid wall. Anything that touches it will crumble and lose its shape. Should her initial attack miss, a great deal of smoke is created by the effects of the acid, so a follow-up attack can be conducted while the enemy's vision remains obscured. It can even melt chakra-based defences such as the [[Susanoo]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 563, page 8</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n{{ImgRight|Mei's Melting Apparition Technique.png|The technique's initial appearance in the anime.}}\n* The phrase {{translation|\"Melting Apparition\"|溶怪|Yōkai}} is a pun on the Japanese words {{translation|\"apparition/demon\"|妖怪|[[Wikipedia:Yōkai|yōkai]]}} and {{translation|\"dissolution\"|溶解|yōkai}}.\n* In games, movies and initially in the anime, this technique was depicted to look like lava.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Lava Release: Planet-Branding Blast]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Lava: Aparición de Fusión]]\n[[fr:Yôton - Dissolution Monstrueuse]]\n[[pl:Yōton: Yōkai no Jutsu]]"
