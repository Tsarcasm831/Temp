By doing so, the user can manipulate the flow of [[chakra]] within their opponent, similar the the Gentle Fist fighting style. Shira can unblock his opponents' tenketsu, with a single impact with his fist.\n\nWhile seemingly not hampering the opponent in any other way, it seems to prevent the opponent from initiating the surge of chakra when the [[Eight Gates]] are opened.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Accurately targeting the tenketsu is normally a near-impossible feat for one without the [[Byakugan]]. This shows very advanced aim and physiological knowledge on Shira's part.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Gentle Fist]]\n* [[Gentle Fist: Tenketsu Needle]]\n* [[Last Resort: Eight Gates Crumbling Attack]]"
