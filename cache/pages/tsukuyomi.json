Through his unprecedented ability to alter targets' perception of time,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 478, page 3</ref> he uses Tsukuyomi to subject victims to days' worth of torture in a matter of seconds; examples include continual stabbing or reliving traumatic events over and over.<ref name=\"c142\">''Naruto'' chapter 142, pages 15-18</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 147, page 15</ref> Tsukuyomi's illusions are usually represented as an inverted grey scale; in the anime, there is usually also a red moon in a red sky. Because of the power of the Mangekyō Sharingan and the speed with which Tsukuyomi works, normal methods of countering genjutsu are ineffective against it.<ref name=\"c257\">''Naruto'' chapter 257, pages 7-8</ref>\n\nUsing Tsukuyomi requires a great deal of [[chakra]], making it inadvisable for Itachi to continue fighting after using it.<ref name=\"c257\"/> Like all Mangekyō Sharingan abilities, Tsukuyomi also places strain on Itachi's eyes when performed, blurring his vision.<ref name=\"c388\">''Naruto'' chapter 388, pages 13-15</ref> However, victims of Tsukuyomi have it far worse, as they are ordinarily rendered comatose as soon as Tsukuyomi's illusion is completed. [[Sharingan]] users can briefly resist unconsciousness,<ref name=\"c142\"/> but only particularly skilled Sharingan users can actually break free of Tsukuyomi's influence.<ref name=\"c388\"/> [[Tsunade]] is the only person known to be capable of [[medical ninjutsu|heal]]ing the psychological damage caused by Tsukuyomi.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 172, page 15</ref> In ''[[Akatsuki Hiden]]'', Itachi theorises that love can be used to revive victims, his reasoning being that, since Tsukuyomi destroys the spirit, feelings that reconnect the spirit can undo Tsukuyomi; [[Kodaka]] does indeed do this in order to resuscitate his younger brother, [[Kiiro]].\n\nAccording to ''[[Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night]]'', \"the time that passed within this genjutsu was one one-hundredth of one one-thousandth of one one-millionth of that of the real world.\"<ref>Taken literally, this means one second of time within Tsukuyomi's illusion is equivalent to 1 x 10<sup>-11</sup> seconds of real time.</ref> In the novel, Itachi uses Tsukuyomi on [[Izumi Uchiha]], causing her to live through decades of a happy life in the span of a few moments. When she dies of old age within the illusion, her actual body dies as well.\n\n== Influence ==\n{{translation|Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto|<ruby>月読命<rt>ツクヨミノミコト</rt></ruby>||lit. \"Moon-Reading Lord\"}} is the ''[[Wikipedia:Kami|kami]]'' of the moon in ancient Japanese myth and the Shintō religion. He is one of the \"three noble children\" (alongside the sun goddess [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] and the sea and storm god [[Wikipedia:Susanoo|Susanoo]]) born when [[Wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi]] [[Wikipedia:Misogi|cleansed]] himself of [[Wikipedia:Kegare|defilement]] after escaping from the [[Wikipedia:Yomi|underworld]], with Tsukuyomi born when Izanagi washed out his right eye. According to the ''[[Wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]]'', Amaterasu's wrath over Tsukuyomi's killing of the [[Wikipedia:Ukemochi|goddess of food]] led to the sun goddess refusing to ever look at Tsukuyomi's face again, forever moving to another part of the sky while Tsukuyomi's fear of his sister's wrath makes him hide during the day (hence explaining why day and night are separate).\n\nAccording to some modern interpretations, Tsukuyomi is thought of as a god of time, or at least of the calendar; the basis for this is the interpretation of \"moon reading\" as reading the movements of the moon, an act paired with reading the calender(=day), and the verb {{translation|''read''|読み|yomi}} being used in the ''[[Wikipedia:Man'yōshū|Man'yōshū]]'' and other books to refer to counting the days of the month. This connection may be referenced by Itachi's ability to manipulate a victim's sense of time within Tsukuyomi's dreamscape.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* During the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], Itachi states his intention to use Tsukuyomi on [[Kabuto Yakushi]] in order to find out how to stop the [[Impure World Reincarnation]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 578</ref> It's unclear if the genjutsu he ends up using is in fact Tsukuyomi,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 588</ref> as such a form of information-gathering is usually done with [[Genjutsu: Sharingan]].\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'', Itachi uses Tsukuyomi by having the red moon crush the opponent while the image of the moon warps into a copy of his Mangekyō Sharingan.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Infinite Tsukuyomi]]\n* [[Kotoamatsukami]]\n* ''[[Kurama Clan's Kekkei Genkai]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[da:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[de:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[es:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[fr:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[id:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[it:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[lt:Tsukujomi]]\n[[pl:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[pt-br:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[ro:Tsukuyomi]]\n[[ru:Цукуёми]]\n[[uk:Цукуйомі]]\n[[vi:Tsukuyomi]]"
