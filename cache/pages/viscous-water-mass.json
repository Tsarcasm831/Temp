He is able to contort his body in various ways and even summon extra limbs. Nurari is able to shed layers of his suit, making him immune to techniques like [[Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique]] and also seems to be able to manipulate the liquid's viscosity and stickiness. He can extract this liquid in the form of projectiles to throw at his opponents in order to trap them, incapacitate them, or to pin them down. He can also form the membrane into barriers in order to nullify incoming projectile attacks.\n\n[[pl:Nensuikai]]"
