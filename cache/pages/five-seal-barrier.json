One of the tags is applied to a central location that the user wishes to prevent access to, while the other four are applied to surfaces in the surrounding area. So long as at least one of the tags remains in place, a [[barrier]] will be created over the central location that prevents it from being opened or in any way physically damaged. Those wishing to remove the barrier are advised to break into two small teams for maximum efficiency: one team focuses on removing the four surrounding tags, while the second team removes the central tag and immediately afterwards storms the stronghold.<ref name=\"d3\"/>\n\nThe Five-Seal Barrier erected over an [[Akatsuki]] lair in the [[Land of Rivers]] has tags spread across an incredibly wide area, with one tag being 500 meters northeast of the lair's entrance and another being 800 meters southwest of the entrance.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 263</ref> This means having a [[sensor]] among those intending to breach a Five-Seal Barrier can save a significant amount of time.<ref name=\"d3\"/> Because the tags, once located, are simple to remove, the [[Pain|Akatsuki leader]] pairs his Five-Seal Barrier with [[Mirrored Sudden Attacker Technique|a booby trap]].<ref>''[[Sha no Sho]]'', page 246</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Gofuu Kekkai]]\n[[es:Barrera de los Cinco Sellos]]\n[[fr:Barrière des Cinq Sceaux]]\n[[pl:Gofū Kekkai]]"
