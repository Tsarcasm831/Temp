All those who fall under its gaze are trapped in the genjutsu, with the [[Rinnegan]]'s design appearing in their eyes to represent its influence. Victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are rendered immobile so long as they are under its effects, allowing them to easily be wrapped by the bark of the God Tree's roots using [[God: Nativity of a World of Trees]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 677</ref> Over the course of years,<ref>''Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise''</ref> humans connected to the tree in this manner are gradually drained of their life energy, personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into [[White Zetsu Army|White Zetsu]]<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 671, pages 8-9</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 679, pages 8-9</ref> while at the same time, producing a new Chakra Fruit in the process. The user can also draw upon the chakra of those bound to the tree, causing it to erupt from the ground and enter their own body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 679, pages 4-5</ref> In the anime, the technique seemed to need perfecting as Kaguya discovered in her first usage: most of those trapped in Infinite Tsukuyomi such as [[Haori]] died after being trapped in the genjutsu instead of being converted into White Zetsu.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 461</ref>\n\nCertain individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The dead, such as those brought back with the [[Impure World Reincarnation]], are impervious to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 677, page 16</ref> White Zetsu, [[Black Zetsu]], and those whose body Black Zetsu [[Body Coating|coats]] are also unaffected.<ref name=\"ch677pg14\" /> However, as seen with [[Orochimaru]], a foreign soul that has taken over the body of a White Zetsu is still vulnerable to the genjutsu.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 677, page 9</ref> A Rinnegan user can block the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, saving themselves and those within their range from its control.<ref name=\"ch677pg14\">''Naruto'' chapter 677, page 14</ref> In fact, Rinnegan users, through the combination with the chakra of the nine [[tailed beasts]], are the only ones capable of ending the Infinite Tsukuyomi and releasing those trapped within its dreams. Should these be possessed by two different people, they must form the rat [[hand seal]] together in order to release the technique.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 692, page 7</ref>\n\n== Known Dreams ==\nThose under the influence of the Infinite Tsukuyomi experience dream worlds where their deepest desires are fulfilled. Only a select few of these dreams have been seen:\n* '''[[Hinata Hyūga]]''' is in a strong and happy relationship with [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. [[Neji Hyūga]] is also alive and watching her from afar with [[Hanabi Hyūga]].\n* '''[[Kiba Inuzuka]]''' is a [[Hokage]], a position he uses to declare a national holiday for dogs.

In the anime, [[Chōjūrō]] and [[Ao]] attend her marriage.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 451</ref>\n* '''[[Tsunade]]''' lives in a [[Konoha]] where none of [[Nawaki|her]] [[Dan Katō|loved]] [[Jiraiya|ones]] died and none of her [[Orochimaru|friends]] turned against the village while Dan became the Hokage. Furthermore, in the anime, Konoha's peace and prosperity prompts Jiraiya to write a [[Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero|book]] about it.\n* '''[[Gaara]]''' has a happy childhood with [[Rasa|his]] [[Karura|parents]], siblings, and [[Yashamaru|uncle]] and he gets to play with Naruto whenever he wants.\n* In the anime, '''[[Yamato]]''' becomes the official leader of [[Team Kakashi|Team 7]] (which includes Sasuke) and is respected throughout Konoha.\n* In the anime, '''[[Killer B]]''' goes on an adventure with his fellow [[jinchūriki]] and their [[tailed beasts]], saving a princess from [[Akatsuki]].\n* In the anime, '''[[Karin]]''' gets revenge on [[Zōsui]] and has Sasuke, who is the Hokage, smile kindly at her again.\n* In the anime, '''[[Sai]]''' learns to properly express himself again and the entire village comes to admire his smile.\n* In the anime, '''[[Kankurō]]''' creates the ultimate puppet, which is a giant transforming robot.\n* In the anime, '''[[Temari]]''' is respected by her siblings so much, they constantly ask for her advice.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|\"Mugen\"|夢幻}} can also be translated as \"dreams\", \"fantasy\", or \"visions\", which fits the nature of this technique.\n* [[Black Zetsu]] revised the [[Stone Tablet]] to state that the Infinite Tsukuyomi is the salvation for the [[Uchiha Clan]] and the key to world peace, something Madara believed in.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 681, page 11</ref>\n* Sasuke referred to this technique as a genjutsu cast by the Rinnegan.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 678, page 11</ref> In the anime, Black Zetsu also connects the technique to the Rinnegan.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 462</ref>\n* In ''[[Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie]]'', Obito casts a {{translation|\"Limited Tsukuyomi\"|限定月読|Gentei Tsukuyomi|lit meaning=Limited Moon Reader}} on Naruto and Sakura, sending them to a [[Genjutsu World]] housed within a [[Telescope Technique|crystal ball]]. As [[Akatsuki]] only has seven [[tailed beasts]] at the time, the Rinne Sharingan used has only seven [[tomoe]].\n* Hagoromo believed that in the past, Kaguya had utilised her Byakugan in some fashion when casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 671, page 9</ref>\n* In the anime, decades later, [[Boro]] would use tales of Infinite Tsukuyomi to persuade many people into joining his cult.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 199</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Labyrinth Genjutsu]]''\n* [[Engraved Tsukuyomi]]\n* [[Tsukuyomi]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Tsukuyomi Infini]]\n[[id:Tsukuyomi Tak Terbatas]]\n[[pl:Mugen Tsukuyomi]]\n[[pt-br:Tsukuyomi Infinito]]\n[[Category:Kekkei Mōra]]"
