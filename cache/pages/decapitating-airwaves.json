In other uses, it can repel incoming projectiles, soften the ground for use as a cushion, and knock over people. Its power weakens sharply over distances.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nZaku can use this technique with one hand against a single target or with both hands to use against separate targets.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 69</ref> It can be used with both hands towards a single purpose,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 53</ref> which in certain cases qualifies as [[Extreme Decapitating Airwaves]]. Despite how useful this technique is and how easy it is for Zaku to perform,<ref name=\"d1\"/> the tubes in his arms represent a serious vulnerability: if the openings of the tubes are blocked when Zaku tries to use it, the energy won't be able to get out and will burst from his elbows, severing them from his body.<ref name=\"c70\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Ondas Decapitadoras]]\n[[fr:Ondes Cinglantes]]\n[[pl:Zankūha]]\n[[pt-br:Ondas Sonoras Decapitadoras]]"
