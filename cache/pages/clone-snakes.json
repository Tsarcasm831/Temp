They also have incredible regenerative abilities. Kabuto not only created a clone of [[Hidan]] using this technique, he also created one of [[Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone|Naruto with Kurama's chakra]] as well. However, for Hidan, the clone snakes have a short lifespan, with what they form into eventually suffering a cellular breakdown within 48 hours of existence.\n\n[[es:Clonación Celular de Serpientes]]\n[[fr:Serpents Clones]]\n[[pt-br:Clone de Cobras]]"
