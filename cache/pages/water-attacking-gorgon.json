[[Shizuku]] has been known to transform it into a dragon with a gaping mouth to attack. The water used will be stationary till it is sent offensively toward the opponent.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The Japanese romanisation of this technique has a pun: the \"Gorugon\" part is also the [[Wikipedia:Gairaigo|Japanese way to pronounce the English word]] \"Gorgon\". A [[wikipedia:gorgon|gorgon]] is a woman with snakes in place of her hair, and this technique is a reference to the gorgon, as Shizuku summons a sphere of water around her and shoots many serpentine streams of water in multiple directions from the sphere.\n\n[[es:Conjunto de Agua Gorgon]]\n[[pl:Suishū Gorugon]]\n[[pt-br:Górgona Atacante de Água]]"
