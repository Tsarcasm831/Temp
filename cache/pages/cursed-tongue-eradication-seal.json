After Danzō died, the seals disappeared from all the Root members.\n\nWhen the wearer of this cursed seal speaks about anything incriminating related to Danzō or Root, their entire body will be paralysed, taking away their ability to speak or move. It is applied to the tongue and takes the shape of three solid lines and two broken lines from the back of the tongue to the tip.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This seal is possibly a [[Wikipedia:I Ching hexagrams|hexagram]].
