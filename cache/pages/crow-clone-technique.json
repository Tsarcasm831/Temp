Because it uses crows as a medium, it requires less [[chakra]] than the normal [[Shadow Clone Technique]], while still being able to perform techniques. The dozens of crows then come together to form the body of a clone. The same crows of the dispersed clone can regroup and form a new clone immediately.\n\nWhen the chakra projected by the user is severed, the crows disperse, though the user is still able to continue to speak through it. When the crow clone is defeated, the crows can regroup to form a new clone immediately, or failing that, can be used to blind the opponent, leaving them open to a counter-attack.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Clon de Cuervos]]\n[[fr:Clone de Corbeau]]\n[[pl:Karasu Bunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Clone de Corvo]]"
