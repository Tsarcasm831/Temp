This technique allows for high-level infiltration and stealth. By travelling down a target's mouth, even a recently deceased one, the user is also able to possess them, controlling the body's full range movements and actions as if their own personal body, even talking. Due to this form's fluid and malleable nature, physical attacks will harmlessly pass through them. However, this technique is very vulnerable to [[Lightning Release]] and still vulnerable to chakra disruption by an opponent.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Earth Release: Mud Body Technique]]''\n* [[Hydrification Technique]]\n* ''[[Iburi Clan's Kekkei Genkai]]''\n* ''[[Sand Body]]''\n* [[Water Replacement]]\n\n[[fr:Suiton - Corps Aqueux]]\n[[ru:Стихия Воды: Водяное Тело]]"
