It allows him to assume the identity of any individual for a variety of purposes: though similar in nature to the standard [[Transformation Technique]], it boasts far greater utility.\n\n== Usage ==\nHaving no fixed appearance or smell, this technique allows White Zetsu to alter his form and chakra, at will. In becoming the perfect duplicate of another individual, he will even possess chakra identical to that of the one that he is impersonating along with any clothing they might be wearing or tools they may be carrying.<ref name=\"ch487\">''Naruto'' chapter 487, pages 14-16</ref> The clones can also use this technique to copy a target's abilities. Typically, White Zetsu would employ his [[parasite clone]]s to serve as substitutes; he was able to control these clones remotely and remained aware of their actions and experiences.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 505, page 11</ref> The transformed clones can even retain the appearance of the person they were impersonating after death, reverting to its true form only after the technique was voluntarily released by the original White Zetsu.<ref name=\"ch487\"/> Because the substitute is weaker than the original individual, their primary purpose is to function as a diversion.<ref name=\"ch487\"/>\n\nIn an effort to increase [[Akatsuki]]'s military power, [[Kabuto Yakushi]] conducted research with a captured [[Yamato]] to enhance the [[White Zetsu Army]]. In the anime, however, the army's clones were regularly shown using copied techniques and could endure prolonged battle.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 279</ref> Unlike the original's version, the technique is seemingly dispersed once the transformed soldier is dealt with a significant amount of damage or killed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 540, pages 8-9</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 545, page 11</ref> Additionally, these clones demonstrated the ability to partially revert to their true forms while transformed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 558, page 14</ref><ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 303</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the manga, the clone used as a substitute for [[Kisame Hoshigaki]] resembles a regular parasite clone.<ref name=\"ch487\"/> In the anime, however, the clone possesses the [[Wikipedia:Venus flytrap|Venus flytrap]]-like extensions that protrude from the side of the original White Zetsu, as well as the clothing that White Zetsu was wearing at the time.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 217</ref>\n* In both the manga and anime, the transformed clones were shown to bleed when damaged. However, in ''[[Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie]]'', limbs severed from transformed clones were shown to leak a white substance, similar to [[Obito Uchiha]]'s artificial arm. One clone was also shown to regenerate its lost limb upon reverting to its true form.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Face Copying Technique]]\n* [[Shadow Mirror Body Changing Method]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Sustitución]]\n[[fr:Technique de Substitution]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Substituto]]\n[[pl:Narikawari no Jutsu]]"
