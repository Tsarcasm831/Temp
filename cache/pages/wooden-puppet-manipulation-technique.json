Alternatively, the puppets can attack the opponent on their own, though the ability to react to their opponent's movements is limited. If the tag is removed, then the technique can then be disabled.\n\n[[Genshō Ryūdōin]] was able to use this technique on a massive scale, forcing hundreds of puppets upon his opponents. Additionally, he was able to break them apart and fuse them together. Together, they created a massive wall capable of holding someone back as strong as [[Might Guy]].\n\n\n[[pl:Mokujin Sōjutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Manipulação das Marionetes de Madeira]]"
