In order to take advantage of this, the technique formula is often applied to projectile weapons, such as Minato's [[Flying Thunder God Kunai|special kunai]], which can quickly be scattered around a battlefield to create several teleportation destinations that can be escaped to and subsequently attacked from.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 542, pages 13-15</ref>\n\nBoth Tobirama and Minato were famed as the fastest shinobi during their lifetimes.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 661, page 9</ref> While both were very fast on their own, the Flying Thunder God also contributed to their fame. During the [[Third Shinobi World War]], Minato's extensive usage of the Flying Thunder God led to his moniker as \"[[Konoha]]'s Yellow Flash\":<ref name=\"d2\"/> he would randomly appear behind enemy lines and, by seemingly being in many places at once, wipe out whole squadrons before they had time to react.<ref name=\"c242\"/> By combining their naturally good reflexes with the instantaneousness of the Flying Thunder God, Tobirama could intercept and redirect a [[Truth-Seeking Ball]] mid-detonation<ref name=\"c641\"/> and Minato could escape [[Kamui]] mid-capture.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 502, page 10</ref> Minato's ability to dodge [[Fourth Raikage|A]]'s [[Lightning Release Chakra Mode]] led A to dub Minato the fastest ninja who ever lived.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 541, page 7</ref>\n\nWhen both Tobirama and Minato are [[Impure World Reincarnation|revived]] during the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], Tobirama was able to link himself with Minato's Flying Thunder God network, allowing him to teleport to the latter's technique formulas.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 650, page 3</ref> Together, they develop the [[Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique]], which allows them to switch places with each other in combat to set-up different manoeuvres.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 641, pages 14-15</ref> During their lives, both developed their own variants of the Flying Thunder God: Tobirama had the [[Flying Thunder God Slash]], which he used to stab opponents the instant he teleported to their side;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 624, page 11</ref> Minato had [[Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder]], which created a [[barrier]] in front of him that teleported incoming attacks to a different location.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 502, page 9</ref>\n\nApproximately two decades later, [[Boruto Uzumaki]] would take inspiration from his grandfather and use his inherent [[Ōtsutsuki Clan|Ōtsutsuki]] [[Ōtsutsuki Teleportation|teleportation]] ability to devise [[Flying Thunder God Technique (Boruto)|an imitation of the ninjutsu]]. Though it produces nearly identical results it is technically different enough to be considered an entirely separate technique, and has more limitations.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 16, pages 1-2</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name ''Hiraishin'' is also the phonic of the Japanese word 避雷針, which means \"[[Wikipedia:Lightning rod|lightning rod]]\". This may suggest the reasoning as to why the technique is restricted towards a seal, because lightning is attracted to lightning rods.\n* The Flying Thunder God Technique has sometimes been referred to as the [[Body Flicker Technique]],<ref name=\"c637\"/> despite the fact that they are fundamentally different.\n* Minato incorporated the Flying Thunder God's mark into his [[Kushina|wife]]'s [[jinchuriki|seal]], allowing him to immediately come to her aid when needed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 501, page 7</ref>\n* Although it's been said that the technique formula can't be removed, its marking has disappeared from individuals that have [[tailed beast]]s sealed into them<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 640, page 1</ref> and extracted from them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 663, page 3</ref>\n* In the anime, Minato's technique formula appears to say 忍愛之剣, made up of the kanji for {{translation|\"endurance\"|忍|nin}}, {{translation|\"love\"|愛|ai}}, {{translation|\"of\"|之|no}}, and {{translation|\"sword\"|剣|ken}}. Tobirama's is more reminiscent of the formula used for [[seal]]s – a random assortment of [[wikipedia:Kanji|Kanji]], [[wikipedia:Hindi script|Hindi script]], and other symbols.\n* In video games, Minato's use of the Flying Thunder God Technique creates a yellow flash, in reference to his nickname.\n* Originally, before Tobirama's second revival, the Flying Thunder God technique was said to be Minato's original technique,<ref>''[[Tō no Sho]]'', page 149</ref> but it was then retconned to him learning it.<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 270</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Amenotejikara]]\n* [[Claw Mark]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[da:Hiraishin no Jutsu]]\n[[de:Hiraishin no Jutsu]]\n[[es:Jutsu del Dios Trueno Volador]]\n[[fr:Dieu du Tonnerre Volant]]\n[[hu:Hiraishin no Jutsu]]\n[[id:Teknik Dewa Guntur Terbang]]\n[[it:Volo del Dio del Fulmine]]\n[[pl:Hiraishin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Raijin Voador]]\n[[ru:Техника Летящего Бога Грома]]\n[[tr:Uçan Yıldırım Tanrısı Tekniği]]"
