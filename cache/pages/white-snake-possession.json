This technique is similar in concept to the [[Yamanaka clan]]'s [[Mind Body Switch Technique]], where the user's original body is left defenceless after taking control of someone else's. Orochimaru used this technique to control [[Kajika]] and so test the extent of [[Sasuke Uchiha]]'s power.\n\n[[fr:Possession du Serpent Blanc]]\n[[pl:Opętanie Białego Węża]]\n[[pt-br:Possessão da Cobra Branca]]\n[[tr:Beyaz Yılan Hakimiyeti]]"
