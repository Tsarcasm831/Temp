It's powerful enough to keep up with a [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode|fully manifested Kurama]] and even put it down, requiring a [[Majestic Attire: Susanoo|Susanoo support]] to [[Hurricane Thunderclap — Majestic Attire Sword Stroke|defeat]] it. Although, it should be noted Kurama had half of its chakra drained by Momoshiki before Naruto was rescued.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While unnamed in the movie and manga, this technique was named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''.\n* Momoshiki's ability to create a [[Pheasant Hunter|pheasant]], [[Inukaitakerunomikoto|dog]] and monkey is influenced by the tale of [[wikipedia:Momotarō|Momotarō]], who befriends the three animals.\n** If this technique were to follow the same naming format as [[Inukaitakerunomikoto]], it would be named {{translation|Sasamorihikonomikoto|楽々森彦命|Tranquil Forest Young Lord}}, after Morihiko Sasa, one of the three retainers in the legend of [[Wikipedia:Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto|Kibitsu Hiko no Mikoto]].\n* In ''[[Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Voltage]]'', Momoshiki has a version of this jutsu called {{translation|Second Demon God: Slaughter|二鬼神・暴虐|Nikishin: Bōgyaku}} in which he summons Monkey Rock to slam the ground, creating a volcanic area of erupting flames before him.\n* In [[The Ōtsutsuki Invasion|''Boruto'' episode 62]], Momoshiki is briefly seen creating earthen golems. The golems lack the flames that would otherwise be indicative of this technique.\n* In the novelisation of ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'', Momoshiki releases a Fire Release that he's [[Takamimusubinokami|absorbed]] and shapes it into a huge monkey and dog; its power is noted to be a result of the chakra he's just taken from [[Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki]]. The two forms are defeated by a [[Rasengan]] and [[Chidori]].\n\n[[fr:Rocher du Singe]]\n[[pl:Saruiwa]]"
