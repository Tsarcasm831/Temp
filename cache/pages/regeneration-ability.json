Because of their origin, their DNA is very similar to Hashirama's, as revealed by [[Shizune]] and [[Sakura Haruno]]'s autopsy results.\n\n== Usage ==\nThis ability has the advantage of healing most damage that the user sustains without the need for [[hand seals]]. In this regard, [[Madara Uchiha]] compares it to [[Tsunade]]'s [[Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 578, page 6</ref> The enhanced regeneration granted by the cells is so rapid that even dozens of puncture wounds, on top of various injuries inflicted by the combined physical assault of all nine [[tailed beasts]] were completely healed in mere moments. This ability does not appear to extend to severed limbs as Madara instead replaced his severed arm with that of a White Zetsu clone's.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 658, page 14</ref><ref name=\"c659p11\" />\n\n== Improvement ==\nAfter becoming the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]], Madara claimed that it was impossible for him to be defeated as he gained [[wikipedia:Biological immortality|a form of \"immortality\"]] from how far his regeneration's ability had ascended,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 673, page 13</ref> as he regenerated the half of his torso blown away by [[Night Guy]] and regenerated even after [[Sasuke Uchiha]] fully [[Chidori Sharp Spear|bisected]] him at the waist.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 676, page 1</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite the Regeneration Ability being similar to a [[kekkei genkai]], it was never said to be one.\n* With the genetic tissue transplanted into Madara and the artificial limbs for Obito each comprised of Hashirama's DNA, they both not only gained Hashirama's healing abilities, but also they no longer required any food or water to survive.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 603, page 1</ref> However, it is unknown if these two traits are related or if Hashirama himself was also endowed with the latter.\n* Though [[Jūgo]] was in possession of Hashirama's cells at one point, he automatically converted them into his own before having a chance to use this ability.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 618, page 13</ref>\n* Those who possess a fragment of the [[Stone of Gelel]] inside their bodies will gain regenerative powers comparable to this ability.<ref>''Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel''</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Mugino]] states to be able to use [[Wood Release]] a person must have the First [[Hokage]]'s cells, which suggests that the Wood Release user [[Moegi Kazamatsuri]] has access to this ability.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 159</ref>\n* In the anime, rumors have spread that the Regeneration Ability also will restore one's youth and extend their longevity. Konoha-nin however have denied such claims.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 161</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Body Revival Technique]]\n* [[Ultra-Fast Regeneration Technique]]\n* [[Yin Healing Wound Destruction]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Capacité de Régénération]]\n[[pl:Saisei Nōryoku]]\n[[pt-br:Habilidade de Regeneração]]"
