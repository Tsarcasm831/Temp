Because opponents can't see it, and because of how precise Baki can be with his attacks, there is little opponents can do to defend against this technique. The Blade of Wind is to the [[Sickle Weasel Technique]] what a [[sword|longsword]] is to a [[kunai]].<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, the technique is seen being used in rapid succession in the form of disk-like projectiles with 'streams' of wind following its rotation. It had enough power to launch [[Hayate Gekkō|a grown man]] several feet into the air.<ref name=\"NS307\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 307</ref>\n* In [[Naruto Mobile|''Naruto Mobile'']], Reto uses the technique in a way that is more similar to the blade version a [[Sickle Weasel Technique]] than this.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2]]'' and ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3|3]]'', the attack takes on a drill-like shape.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Beast Tearing Palm]]\n* [[Wind Cutter Technique]]\n* [[Wind Release: Vacuum Wave]]\n* [[Wind Release: Wind Cutter Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Espada de Viento]]\n[[fr:Épée du Vent]]\n[[pl:Kaze no Yaiba]]\n[[pt-br:Lâmina de Vento]]"
