It is composed of all five elemental [[Nature Transformation|nature transformations]] as well as [[Yin–Yang Release]].<ref name=\"chpt689\">''Naruto'' chapter 689, page 7</ref><section end=summary />\n\n== Usage ==\nKaguya Ōtsutsuki used the [[God Tree]] to absorb chakra from all the people trapped inside the [[God: Nativity of a World of Trees]] technique to create a maximised [[Truth-Seeking Ball]]. A vast expanding mass of chaos with power to reshape the world by obliterating it to nothing first. Unlike the standard Truth-Seeking Ball, which a user starts with a set amount of spheres that cannot be regenerated if lost or destroyed, this technique does not have such limitations and can be generated from nothing.\n\nThe sphere will continue to expand until it overwrites the previous dimension, completely annihilating it. If this happens, even previously synced [[Space–Time Ninjutsu]] will be unable to return to the new dimension.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 689, pages 7-8</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the original publication of [[I Love You|chapter 689]], [[Black Zetsu]] lists [[Wood]] as one of the component natures of the Expansive Truth-Seeking Balls, rather than [[Water]].<ref name=\"chpt689\"/> [[Masashi Kishimoto]] confirmed this was an error in Issue #41 of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'', and stated that it would be corrected in the [[I Love You (volume)|tankōbon release]] of the chapter.<ref>Weekly Shōnen Jump Issue 41 Author Comments</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Kekkei Mōra]]\n\n[[id:Bola Mencari Kebenaran Lebar]]\n[[fr:Sphère de Vérité Géante]]\n[[pl:Bōchō Gudōdama]]\n[[pt-br:Esfera Expandida do Caminho da Verdade]]"
