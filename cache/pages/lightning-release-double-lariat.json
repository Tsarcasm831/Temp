Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as ''Zetsugyū Rairi Nettō''.\n* This technique is used as a test to see who will be worthy to become the [[Raikage]]'s [[A–B Combo|tag-team partner]], as the potential candidate must be able to synchronise their strength with the Raikage. As such, this technique is feared even outside of Kumogakure.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 542, page 7</ref>\n* This move might be a reference to the move from the [[Wikipedia:Kinnikuman|Kinnikuman]] manga series called [[w:c:kinnikuman:Quarrel Bomber|Cross Bomber]] usually performed by [[w:c:kinnikuman:Neptuneman|Neptuneman]] and [[w:c:kinnikuman:Big the Budo (Neptune King)|Big The Budo]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Doble Lariat]]\n[[fr:Raiton - Double Lariat]]\n[[pl:Raiton: Daburu Rariatto]]"
