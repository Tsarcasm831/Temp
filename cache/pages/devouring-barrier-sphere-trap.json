If the target is not aware of the camouflaged tags, the presence of the target will ignite the trap automatically. Once activated, a dark red [[chakra]] sphere will form, trapping the target inside. Anyone caught in the trap as it activates will be compressed in its container, devoured, and crushed.\n\nThe trap was dispelled by [[Shikamaru]] via [[Shadow Sewing Technique]] before it could do so. When it is dispelled, it will be shattered like broken glass and disappear.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique is somewhat similar mechanics to the [[Curse Mandala]] technique, as both allow to manipulate the size of a shape composed of chakra and crushing the target inside the container. The difference is, the Curse Mandala needs some hand seal to activate, but this technique is running automatically.\n\n[[pt-br:Barreira Esférica da Armadilha Devoradora]]"
