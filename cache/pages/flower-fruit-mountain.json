While in his [[Version 2|transformed]] state, Rōshi creates a volcano which then explodes violently, sending molten rock flying up in all directions the effects of which resemble a giant flower. The lava produced is said to be able to melt anything in its path.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The summit of the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Mount Huaguo|Mountain of Flowers and Fruits]]|花果山|Ja: Kakazan, Ch: Huāguǒshān}} is the birthplace of Sūn Wùkōng, the main character of the Chinese novel ''[[Wikipedia:Journey to the West|Journey to the West]]''. The mountain is located on a volcanic island. The Four-Tails, of course, is based on Sūn Wùkōng and the ''Dragon Ball'' series, which in turn is also based on ''Journey to the West''.\n* When written as 火山, kazan means 'volcano'.\n* In an anime exclusive sequence, Rōshi, while offscreen, used what appears to be this technique when colliding with [[Kisame]]'s [[Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave]] technique.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 121</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Montaña de Frutas y Flores]]\n[[fr:Éruption de Fleurs]]\n[[ka:ყვავილი-ხილის მთა]]\n[[pl:Kakazan]]\n[[pt-br:Monte Huaguo]]"
