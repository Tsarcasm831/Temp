Next, the user forms a unique [[hand seal]] resembling a tiger. This launches the air pressure at the opponent in the shape of one by leaving a gigantic tiger-shaped impression into the initially built-up air pressure with the hand seal. The air pressure will condense as it's moving and be focused into a single point. The technique then explodes on command, releasing the built up air pressure in an instant. A massive explosion — one that dwarfs [[Island Turtle]] — is created which can be felt a significant distance away.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 507, pages 4-7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The unique hand seal used in this technique resembles the {{translation|\"Tō\"|闘|}} seal, also known as the \"seal of the outer lion\" which is used in the practice of [[Wikipedia:Kuji-in|Kuji-in]].\n* Hirudora may also be written as 昼ドラ, which is a contraction for hirudorama, meaning daytime TV-drama. These were Japanese soap-operas aired during daytime, primarily aimed at female audiences. They all <span class=\"plainlinks\">[https://www.quora.com/Does-Japan-have-any-long-running-soap-operas-that-have-been-airing-for-decades disappeared]</span> in the early 2000s, due to cost, DVD, DVR etc. This ties in with why Naruto feels the technique's name is melancholic and old-sounding to be used by Might Guy, who is so obsessed with youth.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Evening Elephant]]\n* [[Leaf Dragon God]]\n* [[Morning Peacock]]\n* [[Night Guy]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n[[es:Tigre Matutino]]\n[[fr:Tigre du Zénith]]\n[[pl:Hirudora]]\n[[pt-br:Tigre Diurno]]\n[[ru:Полуденный тигр]]"
