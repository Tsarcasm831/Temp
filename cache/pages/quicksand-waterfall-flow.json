The earth shakes as the sand surfaces, which Gaara then manipulates like a tsunami that he crashes against his targets. Targets are battered multiple times by the waves of sand as it spreads throughout the area. When the sand settles, the landscape is dramatically altered, taking on the appearance of a barren desert. Gaara can then use this sand to perform additional attacks, such as [[Sand Waterfall Imperial Funeral]].<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nBecause of how much sand Gaara uses for this technique, the [[Fourth Kazekage]] assumes he can only use it in [[Tailed Beast Mode]] in order to gain access to the full power of [[Shukaku]]. He is subsequently surprised to see Gaara using it on his own.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 546</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Tsunami de Arena]]\n[[fr:Déferlante de Sables Mouvants]]\n[[pl:Ryūsa Bakuryū]]\n[[pt-br:Cachoeira de Areia Movediça]]"
