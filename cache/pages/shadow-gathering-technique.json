It is accurate enough to even make the tentacles go through tiny holes. Basically, this technique takes the user's own shadow and transforms and stretches it into countless thin tentacles, which are then used to grab objects and pull them in. Also, one can skilfully make use of the tentacle-shaped shadow tendrils by using them to lift up and throw weapons like kunai and such. This technique has many possible applications and uses. \n\nThere are no hand seals used for this technique, but the hand movements resemble that of [[Gaara]]'s [[Sand Binding Coffin]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|Yose|寄せ|gathering}} is also the Japanese term for endgame. That is, the final moves in strategy games like [[Wikipedia:Chess|chess]], [[Wikipedia:Shogi|shōgi]], or [[Wikipedia:Go (game)|Go]]. This translation is almost as perfect as gathering in this case, since this technique was the final move in Shikamaru's shōgi-themed mission.\n* In ''[[Naruto: The Broken Bond]]'', Shikamaru used this technique in Part I.\n* Shikamaru was shown training Shikadai in the basics of this technique.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 19</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Juego Final de la Sombra]]\n[[fr:Invocation des Ombres]]\n[[pl:Kageyose no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Puxão pela Sombra]]"
