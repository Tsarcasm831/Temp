They will pursue their targets relentlessly in order to clamp down on them with their jaws, restraining and crushing them, and their tracking speed is so great that they were even able to catch [[Sasuke Uchiha]].<ref>''Weekly Shonen Jump No. 4-5'' page 274, Borukura!!! Special Edition: Next Generation Ninja Arts</ref>\n\nThe user can also [[Takamimusubinokami|transmit]] other ninjutsu through the body of one of the canines so that, after it grabs hold of a target, it will result in a direct hit.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 65</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name of this technique comes from the Japanese legend of [[Wikipedia:Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto|Kibitsu Hiko no Mikoto]], a prince who, with the help of his three retainers, defeated a demon. One of his retainers was named {{translation|\"Takeru Inukai\"|犬飼健|Inukai Takeru}}. The tale of [[Wikipedia:Momotarō|Momotarō]], which is the source of Momoshiki's name, is based on this legend. Here, Momotarō befriends a dog, a [[Monkey Rock|monkey]] and a [[Pheasant Hunter|pheasant]] instead, and it is said that the dog is based on Takeru Inukai.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[it:Inukai Takeru no Mikoto]]\n[[it:Tecnica del Dio Canino]]\n[[fr:Inukaitakerunomikoto]]\n[[pl:Inukaitakerunomikoto]]"
