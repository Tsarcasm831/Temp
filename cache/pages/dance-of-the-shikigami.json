These spirits are often depicted as changing into small pieces of paper once harmed or finished with their task. In the name of this technique, the kanji for {{translation|\"god\"|神|kami}} has been replaced with the kanji for {{translation|\"paper\"|紙|kami}}, which is pronounced the same. This is likely done to emphasise the paper nature of Konan's shikigami and to point out the subtle difference between them and traditional shikigami.\n* Her ability to make wings out of paper mirrors her title as \"[[Nagato|God]]'s Angel\" in [[Amegakure]].<ref name=\"c371\" />\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Mail Manipulation Technique]]''\n* ''[[Origami Replacement Technique]]''\n* [[Paper Person of God Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Danse du Shikigami]]\n[[pl:Shikigami no Mai]]\n[[pt-br:Dança do Shikigami]]\n[[uk:Танець Шікіґамі]]"
