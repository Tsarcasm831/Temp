The user will expel a glowing bubble from their mouth that releases blinding violet rays, which reacts to the person's Byakugan to project images into their mind. However, only those who are worthy are capable of seeing the vision while those from outside the determined targeted area are incapable of doing so. After the vision is transferred, the sphere can be retracted to the user.\n\n[[es:Visión Compartida del Pasado]]"
