Focusing their efforts through the centre of the hands gesture, the user can scan the area for that particular target. The range of this technique can be greatly expanded by distributing user's chakra over a wide area, as seen from Inojin using his [[Super Beast Imitating Drawing]] which are infused with his chakra.\n\n[[fr:Verrouillage de Chakra]]\n[[ru:Пометка Чакры]]"
