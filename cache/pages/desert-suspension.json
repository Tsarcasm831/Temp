One of the simpler purposes for this technique is as a defence, lifting Gaara out of reach of attacks.<ref name=\"d2\"/> While airborne, Gaara can still use his other techniques, such as forming his [[Shield of Sand]] around the platform for additional protection.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 248</ref> This technique can also be used for transportation, enabling Gaara to travel around quickly. Platforms can be made larger to support allies alongside him, or Gaara can give allies their own platforms.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 662</ref>\n\n[[Shinki]] performs this technique using [[Iron Sand]].<ref>''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Suspensión del Desierto]]\n[[fr:Suspension du Désert]]\n[[pl:Sabaku Fuyū]]\n[[pt-br:Flutuação de Areia]]"
