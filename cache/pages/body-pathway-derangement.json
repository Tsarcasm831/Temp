Tsunade creates an electric field by giving her chakra the properties of electricity. When she strikes a target with her hand, the electricity pours into their nervous system and rearranges their body's signals. Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves. But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement ''other'' than what the brain intends. When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nThe target can partially overcome this technique if they manage to relearn the connection between their brain and their limbs, as [[Kabuto Yakushi]] demonstrates. However, this is not an easy feat and takes a high amount of concentration and intelligence.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 164, pages 16-17</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Because of how its entry in ''[[Tō no Sho]]'' is worded, it isn't clear if this qualifies as [[Lightning Release]].\n* In ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', [[Sakura]] uses this technique by charging [[chakra]] in her hand and thrusting the opponent with her palm, causing damage and leaving the target confused.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Perturbación del Sistema Nervioso]]\n[[fr:Perturbation des Impulsions du Corps]]\n[[pt-br:Choque da Desorientação]]\n[[pl:Ranshinshō]]"
