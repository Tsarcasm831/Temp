The bullets are so fast that they are difficult to see. The moment the user has finished preparing the attack, evading it becomes extremely difficult. Using the repellent force of [[Magnet Release|magnetism]], the speed of the bullets is rapidly increased after they are shot. Furthermore, the user can also use an attack pattern where the Iron Sand bullets are shaped into sharp needles, increasing their ability to wound or kill the opponent.  \n\nSince the Iron Sand has a magnetic force and (when used by Sasori) is also drenched in poison, defending against this technique is almost impossible. This technique is especially threatening to puppet users, since the puppets can be rendered immobile if the sand gets lodged into their joints. \n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Sand Drizzle]]\n* [[Water Release: Drizzle]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Arena de Hierro: Lluvia Dispersa]]\n[[fr:Bruine de Limaille de Fer]]"
