The three puppets get into a triangular formation and by opening the mechanisms marked with \"Buddha\", \"Dharma\", and \"Sangha\", respectively, they invoke this technique. A terrifying tornado breaks out and sucks the targets into the centre of the formation. Everything that is sucked into the centre is completely crushed with tremendous force and shot out from the back. However, the vacuum can be overloaded, leaving the three puppets vulnerable to attacks.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The {{translation|Three Jewels or Three Treasures|三宝|Sanbō}} are a concept from Buddhism and refer to the {{translation|Buddha|仏|Butsu}}, the {{translation|Dharma|法|Hō}} and the {{translation|Sangha|僧|Sō}}. The Buddha refers to either the Gautama Buddha or the concept of the Buddha nature, the Dharma refers to the teachings of the Buddha, and the Sangha to the community of those who have attained enlightenment (or more broadly to all practising Buddhists).\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Sanbou Kyuukai]]\n[[fr:Souffle Dévastateur des Trois Trésors]]\n[[pl:Sanbō Kyūkai]]\n[[pt-br:Destruição Sugadora dos Três Tesouros]]"
