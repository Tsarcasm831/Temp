Unlike other [[clone techniques]], the sand clone's composition is usually obvious at all times, only taking Gaara's shape and not his exact appearance. Because of this, the clone can be reverted to sand at any time, most often when being attacked; as it's punched or kicked, Gaara can use the clone's sand to immediately capture the opponent's limbs. Alternatively, Gaara can use the clone as a decoy, drawing opponents to it and once they're close enough, manipulating the clone's sand against them.<ref name=\"d1\"/> Whereas other clones can only take so much damage before being destroyed, Gaara can reform the sand clone regardless of what happens to it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 111</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], Gaara shows the ability to make a sand clone that looks exactly like the [[Third Tsuchikage]] rather than himself.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 556, page 10</ref> In this case, the sand clone he makes exactly resembles who they're based on, not being sand-shaped lookalikes of previous depictions.\n\nGaara is also able to hide other materials within the sand clones to be used against opponents who attack them, such as [[Gold Dust]] against the [[Second Mizukage]]'s [[Steaming Danger Tyranny]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 557, page 17</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, [[Sasori]] used a sand clone as a [[Body Replacement Technique|replacement]], although it dissolved after being hit.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 8</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Iron Sand Clone]]\n* [[Mud Release: Mud Doll]]\n* [[Clone Trap]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Clone de Sable]]\n[[he:ג'וטסו העתקי חול]]\n[[pl:Suna Bunshin]]\n[[pt-br:Clone de Areia]]"
