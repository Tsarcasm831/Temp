This is meant to catch an enemy when their guard is down. [[Sai]] mentions that this is used as a last resort technique by the [[Anbu]], and as such, is rare; [[Sakura]] likens it to a living time bomb. When [[Kakashi Hatake]] requested Tsunade to use it on him, the technique would activate Kakashi's [[Mangekyō Sharingan]] technique, the [[Kamui]], upon [[Hiruko (missing-nin)|Hiruko's]] attempt to [[Chimera Technique|assimilate him]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Transcription Seal: Amaterasu]]\n* ''[[Transcription Seal: Izanagi]]''\n\n[[de:Jigen Shiki no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Liberação do Tempo]]\n[[fr:Technique à Retardement]]\n[[pl:Jigen Shiki no Jutsu]]"
