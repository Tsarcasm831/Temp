This causes the sacrifice to become the individual's identical copy, complete with perfect imitations of the original's [[kekkei genkai]] (such as the [[Sharingan]]) and unique weapons (such as [[Samehada]]). The original controls their copy remotely, thus making the copy's movements and knowledge indistinguishable as well. However, the copy is limited by how much of the original's chakra they are given, so particularly chakra-taxing [[jutsu]] cannot be used. Once the chakra from the original runs out, the sacrifice reverts to their own appearance and they die.<ref name=\"d3\"/>\n\nPain uses the Shapeshifting Technique to make [[Yūra]] into a copy of [[Itachi Uchiha]] and [[Mukade]] into a copy of [[Kisame Hoshigaki]]. The copies are given 30% of their original's chakra and are used to delay [[Team Kakashi]] and [[Team Guy]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 255, page 13</ref> Despite the copies supposedly being exactly the same as their original, [[Kakashi Hatake]] notices something different about the copy of Itachi, though he doesn't realise why until after the Shapeshifting Technique has ended.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 260, page 15</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Cambio de Forma]]\n[[fr:Transfert de Forme]]\n[[pl:Shōten no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Transferência de Forma]]"
