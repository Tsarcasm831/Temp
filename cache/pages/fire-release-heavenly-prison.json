It will also drain them of their chakra at a slow but steady rate. Mui uses this technique on the prisoners of the [[Hōzuki Castle]]. If the ones who have the seal on them leaves a certain radius from the applier, then it would cause the victims to burst into flames from the inside,<ref name=\"BE146\">''Boruto'' episode 146</ref> burning them to ashes. The user can also ignite the seal at their own free will.\n\nHowever, for people with high amounts of chakra, such as [[Naruto]], they can still mould chakra and use techniques to a certain extent. The techniques used, however, will be severely hampered, and the seal will cause the user in question intense pain, as though their bodies were on fire; if too much chakra is forced out, the formula will set the victim ablaze.\n\nIt is possible for an individual to undo the Heavenly Prison placed by another, as Benga undid \"[[Shojoji|Tsukiyo]]'s\" that was placed by Mujō.<ref name=\"BE146\"/>\n\n== Drawbacks ==\nBeing a fire technique, it cannot work in water, and the victims simply has to submerge themselves in a body of water to use chakra with ease; anyone set aflame by this technique can be saved if water is poured over them. Also, this technique only suppresses normal chakra from within one's body; when enhanced with [[natural energy]] gathered externally, one is still able to use chakra. If anyone with the seal applied were able to create a [[shadow clone]], the clone will not bear the seal. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite being seemingly bound by the Heavenly Prison, [[Maroi]] was able to use [[Lightning Release: Lightning Signal Fire]] and [[Water Release: Archerfish]] without adverse effects. This may due to Maroi gaining favour of Mui, thus negating the sealing.\n** A caster of this technique can place a false seal on the victim, creating only the markings without the effects, as Mujō did on [[Boruto Uzumaki]] and [[Mitsuki]], to allow them to enter the prison undercover.<ref name=\"BE141\">''Boruto'' episode 141</ref> This may be what Mui did on Maroi.\n* Despite Naruto being branded with this technique, when he transformed into Sage Mode, he was able to leave a great distance from Mui when [[Gamabunta]] escaped the castle to rethink their strategy without Naruto bursting into flames.\n* The [[Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice]] has been considered to be on par with the Heavenly Prison in terms of restraining prisoners, hence the reason [[Kahyō|its user]] was named Mui's successor as [[Hōzuki Castle]]'s master.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Cursed Tongue Eradication Seal]]\n* [[Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice]]\n* ''[[Prisoner Cursed Seal]]''\n\n== References ==\n<References/>\n\n[[de:Katon: Tenrou]]\n[[pl:Katon: Tenrō]]\n[[fr:Katon - Entrave Céleste]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Fogo: Prisão Celestial]]"
