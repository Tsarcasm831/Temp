According to [[Shino]], the barrier accelerates the insect's multiplication.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When written as 蠱毒, \"kodoku\" means \"to poison someone\". When written as 孤独, it means \"isolation\", \"loneliness\", or \"solitude\".\n* This technique is likely based on [[Wikipedia:Kodoku|Kodoku]], a Japanese folk curse created by having various insects kill each other in a jar until the last survivor becomes a creature of supernatural influence.\n* As stated by Torune, the Jar of Poison Technique was labelled a kinjutsu due to the sheer volume of corpses required to execute it and the indiscriminate effects of the [[Poison Mist|poisonous cloud]].\n* The appearance of the barrier closely resembles that of the [[Four-Corner Sealing Barrier]].\n\n[[fr:Jarre de Poison]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Jarro de Veneno]]\n[[pl:Kodoku no Jutsu]]"
