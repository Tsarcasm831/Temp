First, the enemy's arms and legs are captured by four chains, and then the walls of the cage appear flat on the ground, quickly folding together to box them in. Finally, a large statue falls atop the cage, which is then tightly bound in chains.\n\nThe floor of the cage is outfitted with a number of gears that can be turned to constrict garrotte wire, which is tightly wrapped around the victim's body. It appears that Ibiki can control the force of the gears using hand seals and chakra, using it as a method of torture and interrogation. He is also able to perceive the pain of the victim.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The statue which crowns the torture chamber is of ''Fukusuke'', the Japanese god of merchant prosperity. One of the lesser known luck gods, statues of Fukusuke can sometimes be found at the entrances to businesses, similar to the ''maneki neko'' statue in Ibiki's [[Summoning: Iron Maiden]] technique. ''Fukusuke'' is typically depicted in a formal kimono, showing respect and appreciation to patrons and customers by deeply bowing.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pl:Kuchiyose: Gōmon Heya]]\n[[pt-br:Invocação: Câmara de Tortura]]"
