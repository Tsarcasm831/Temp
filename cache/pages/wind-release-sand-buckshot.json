This attack is powerful enough to pierce through flesh with ease, and is difficult to dodge, due to the technique's speed and range. \n\nAn additional benefit of this attack is that it pushes the target away from the user and Gaara can then use any of the sand left in his target's bloodstream to immobilise or manipulate them, leaving them vulnerable to follow up attacks.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Fûton - Nuée de Dards de Sable]]\n[[pl:Fūton: Sasandan]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Vento: Dispersão de Balas de Areia]]"
