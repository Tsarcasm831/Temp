It can also be obtained by [[Six Paths Ten-Tails Coffin Seal|becoming]] the [[jinchūriki]] of the [[Ten-Tails]], as taking in the power of the nine [[tailed beasts]] is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 309</ref><section end=summary />\n\n== Overview ==\nSix Paths Senjutsu is suggested to have a connection with the pattern that appears on the user's back when it is used, consisting of a [[Rinnegan]]-like marking above nine [[Wikipedia:Magatama|magatama]], which resembles the pattern on the back of Hagoromo's robe.<ref name=\"ch673\"/> The pattern that appeared on [[Obito Uchiha]]'s back differed slightly from that of other known users, with the Rinnegan-like marking itself being shaped into a magatama.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 638, page 4</ref>\n\nAs a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to [[Sage Mode]], though the user's [[Sensor Type|sensing]] capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of [[Limbo]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, pages 5-7</ref> They also gain a complete comprehension of [[chakra]], including the ability to use all five basic [[nature transformation]]s and make perfect use of [[Yin–Yang Release]],<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 226</ref> as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.<ref name=\"JnS310\">''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 310</ref> When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of [[Truth-Seeking Ball]]s.<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 249</ref>\n\n[[File:Obito's Jinchuriki Form from behind.png|thumb|left|Obito's unique pattern.]]\nAs the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, [[Obito]] and [[Madara]] Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general. The two were entirely immune to the effects of [[ninjutsu]], only being vulnerable to senjutsu and [[taijutsu]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 667, page 8</ref> though techniques utilising [[Six Paths Power]] could also damage them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, pages 11-13</ref> They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 672, pages 14-15</ref> with Madara even claiming to be immortal.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 673, page 13</ref> Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only [[Evening Elephant|techniques]] of the [[Night Guy|highest level]] have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by [[Daytime Tiger]] without harm.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 667, pages 12-13</ref> Obito was capable of producing [[Tailed Beast Chakra Arms|chakra arms]] from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the [[Four Red Yang Formation]] with ease.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 636, pages 10-12</ref> Despite not previously possessing the [[kekkei genkai]], Madara was able to use a [[Storm Release]] [[Sage Art: Storm Release Light Fang|technique]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, page 4</ref> which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 321</ref>\n\nNaruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his [[Six Paths Sage Mode]], a form which he received from Hagoromo.<ref name=\"JnS310\"/> When Naruto used this mode in conjunction with his [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode|chakra cloak]] during the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], he wore a unique shroud with the pattern associated with Six Paths Senjutsu on its back.<ref name=\"ch673\"/> According to [[Sasuke Uchiha]], the Truth-Seeking Balls Naruto used in this form utilised what he called {{translation|\"''Six Paths Sage Chakra''\"|六道の仙人チャクラ|Rikudō no Sennin Chakura}}, which allowed them to damage Madara's shadow.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, page 9</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In a single panel in [[Shift|chapter 656]], the back of Hagoromo's robe is depicted with the same pattern found on Obito's back, rather than the usual pattern.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 656, page 9</ref>\n* In ''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]'', the cloaks worn by Hagoromo, Hamura, Madara (as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki) and Naruto (in Six Paths Sage Mode) are known as {{translation|''Six Paths Haori''|六道羽織|Rikudō Haori}}.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Modo Sabio de los Seis Caminos]]\n[[fr:Senjutsu de Rikudô]]\n[[id:Senjutsu Enam Jalan]]\n[[it:Tecnica Eremitica delle Sei Vie]]\n[[pl:Rikudō Senjutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Sábia dos Seis Caminhos]]\n[[ru:Сендзюцу Шести Путей]]"
