Once this is done, the user can stretch and bend their body however and whenever they please, extending it to great lengths and retracting it again.<ref name=\"d1\"/> This is done by dislocating their joints and then using [[chakra]] to manipulate their body's shape. The technique was originally developed for intelligence gathering so that users could squeeze into smalls spaces.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 70, page 12</ref> In combat, users can wrap around targets to restrain or constrict them, or strike at them with their limbs, the limbs' length making them similar to [[wikipedia:whip|whip]]s.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Rokurokubi|Rokurokubi]]|ろくろ首}} are yōkai that were originally humans, but broke the precepts or doctrines of Buddhism.
