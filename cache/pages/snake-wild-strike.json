Special'', Anko uses the finisher straightaway instead on its own, along with the snakes/hitboxes being shot-out as a larger funnel array.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Akin to the [[Nine-Tailed Naruto Wild Attack]], this attack's entire sequence despite requiring an initial blow will scale normally with damage scaling due to not being a cinematic attack."
