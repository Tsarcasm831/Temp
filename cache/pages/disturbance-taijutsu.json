This style, comprised of sheer unpredictable movements, can easily catch his opponents off-guard. Even those who wield the [[Sharingan]] have shown to have had trouble keeping up with B's movements and were forced to go on the defensive or retreat.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 411, page 11-15</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 549, pages 14-17</ref> B is also able to employ this technique against multiple of opponents, as shown in his fight with [[Taka]].\n\nCombining this fighting style's wild nature with swords, B is able to increase the lethality of his attacks. B, using any number of swords can easily close in on and exploit an opponent's vital points.<ref name=\"d4\" /> To maximise the style's killing potential, he could, in tandem with his seven [[Kumogakure Swords|swords]], make use of his unique and peculiar [[kenjutsu]] [[Acrobat]].<ref name=\"d4\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Taijutsu de Perturbation]]\n[[pt-br:Taijutsu de Agitação]]"
