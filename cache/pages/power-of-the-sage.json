He then uses the [[Fire Release: Fire Dragon Flame Bullet]] on the opponent and slams his [[Rasengan]] onto them, absorbing the fire [[chakra]] and forms into the [[Fire Release: Great Flame Rasengan]] with a white orb inside instead of black. The Rasengan is released from Jiraiya's hand, and instead of an explosion of fire, when the opponent hits the ground like the Great Flame Rasengan, a small cyclone composed of flame appears and after disappearing for a few seconds, rain made of fire falls to the ground at a dramatic speed."
