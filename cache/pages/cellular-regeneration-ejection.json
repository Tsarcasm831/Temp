Because he is transferring his cells to the recipient, Jūgo's own body regresses in age, becoming younger in appearance. The effects, however, are temporary and can be reverted using the [[Cellular Regeneration Absorption|counterpart]] for this technique.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], [[Kabuto Yakushi]] revived [[Sasuke Uchiha]] in a similar manner, by connecting his navel snake with Sasuke's torso and apparently using [[Hashirama Senju]]'s cells, along with a [[Tobirama Senju|certain someone]]'s advice.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Absorción Corporal]]\n[[fr:Transfert de Cellules de Régénération]]\n[[pt-br:Regeneração de Ejeção Celular]]"
