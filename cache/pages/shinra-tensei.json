In its typical usage, it repels only within a few feet's distance and has enough force to destroy [[earth]]en constructs.<ref name=\"c420\"/> [[Nagato]], after cutting off control of his other [[Six Paths of Pain]] and channelling all his chakra to the Deva Path, performs a Shinra Tensei that is large enough and powerful enough to reduce [[Konohagakure]] to a deep crater; doing this shortens his life<ref name=\"c429\"/> and afterwards dulls the responsiveness of his Six Paths of Pain.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 430, page 14</ref> At its standard strength, opponents can resist Shinra Tensei by securing themselves to the ground: coating their feet with chakra to increase traction,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 429, page 1</ref> digging in deeply enough to counter repulsion,<ref name=\"c438\">''Naruto'' chapter 438, pages 5-6</ref> or [[Multiple Shadow Clone Technique|grouping together]] to minimise the repulsive force's influence.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 443, pages 16</ref> Shinra Tensei also exerts a recoil on the user. If the opponent can withstand the repulsive force and force the user to use enough force, they can turn Shinra Tensei against the user.<ref name=\"c438\" />\n\nAfter Shinra Tensei is performed, there is a brief cooldown period during which it and other Deva Path abilities cannot be used. At a minimum, this cooldown is five seconds. During large-scale uses, such as the one that destroyed Konoha, the cooldown takes several minutes.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 434, page 9-10</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThe names of Shinra Tensei and its companion ability, [[Banshō Ten'in]], are derived from {{translation|''Shinra Banshō''|神羅万象|lit meaning=Everything Covered by God}}, a Japanese [[Wikipedia:Yojijukugo|four-character idiom]] and homophone variant of {{translation|''Shinra Banshō''|森羅万象|lit meaning=All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things}}, a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All of Nature\" or \"All of Creation\".\n\n== Trivia ==\n[[File:Tendo in the orb.png|thumb|The Shinra Tensei orb.]]\n* In the anime, Shinra Tensei is sometimes depicted as an orb of varying colours which surrounds the Deva Path.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble]]'', an enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called {{translation|\"Shinra Tensei: Seiatsu\"|神羅天征・征圧|lit meaning=Heavenly Subjugation of the Omnipresent God: Subjugating Pressure}} can be performed.\n* In ''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4'', Sasuke can use Shinra Tensei while he is in his Complete Body — Susanoo form.\n* In the manga, Kaguya attacks Naruto and his clones with a repulsive force by extending her hand, but the name of the jutsu used is not mentioned.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 685, page 9</ref> In the [[Jump Force]] game, where the ability is seen again, it is confirmed to be Shinra Tensei.\n* In the anime, [[Momoshiki]] repels a burst of Fūma Shuriken through a jutsu with repulsive capabilities, but does not mention its name. Even so, the jutsu in question has the same characteristics as Shinra Tensei, is used through the Rinnegan and Momoshiki has demonstrated that he meets the necessary requirements (being able to manipulate the five basic nature transformations).<ref>''Boruto'' episode 65</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Repulsion Technique]]''\n* [[Ōhirume]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[id:Shinra Tensei]]\n[[ka:შინრა ტენსეი]]\n[[pl:Shinra Tensei]]\n[[pt-br:Shinra Tensei]]\n[[tr:Shinra Tensei]]\n[[fr:Répulsion Céleste]]"
