The penultimate attack hits the opponent in the air, throwing them towards the ground, but the original Naruto intercepts the opponent half-way, extending the reach of his punch with natural energy, sending his opponent flying.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In its début game, the attack was named \"Frog Kata: Roaring Kick\", despite kicks not being part of the finishing strike, which is usually what combos in video-games are named for. In ''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3'', it was changed to \"Frog Kata: Roaring Attack\", more in line with how the technique actually ends."
