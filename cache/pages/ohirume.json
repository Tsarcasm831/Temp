She can create at least four such orbs simultaneously, freely control their positioning, and prevent anything that she wishes not to target from being affected. The jutsu has several versatile applications, such as redirecting incoming threats by attracting them toward a chosen sphere, or allowing Sarada to make herself a target to levitate within the spheres' resulting gravitational field.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 21, pages 10-18 & 20-22</ref>\n\nŌhirume's primary offensive use involves pulling an enemy into contact with a sphere, pinning them against its surface, and then amplifying the gravitational force to the point of implosion—violently crushing the target.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 21, pages 22-32</ref>\n\nAmplifying the gravitational forces of a sphere places significant strain on Sarada, causing her used eye to bleed. The first time she used the technique, she fell unconscious from the exertion.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 21, pages 29-34</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nŌhirume or {{translation|Ōhirume-no-Muchi|<ruby>大日孁貴<rt>おおひるめのむち</rt></ruby>||lit. \"Great Lady/Maiden of the Sun\"}} is one of the many names that, in the ''[[wikipedia:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]]'', is ascribed to [[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]], the Japanese goddess of the sun and chief ''kami'' of the Shintō pantheon. This makes this technique the second Mangekyō Sharingan ability named after said deity, following [[Sasuke]] and [[Itachi Uchiha]]'s [[Amaterasu]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to [[Koji Kashin]], Sarada awakening the technique is one of the most critical goals to battling the [[Human God Tree]]s.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 21, page 35</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Banshō Ten'in]]\n*[[Chibaku Tensei]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Ôhirume]]\n[[pl:Ōhirume]]\n[[pt-br:Ōhirume]]"
