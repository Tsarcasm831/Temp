These transfers are often characterised by a spiralling void that targets swirl into or out of, distorting their form as they move between dimensions. Targets that enter Kamui's dimension are completely untraceable, as not even their [[chakra]] can be detected while they're there.<ref name=\"c395\">''Naruto'' chapter 395, pages 9-10</ref> Targets that exit Kamui's dimension do so with varying force, either simply appearing at the ejection point<ref name=\"c520\">''Naruto'' chapter 520, page 9</ref> or flying from it; if weapons, such as [[shuriken]], are stored in Kamui's dimension, ejecting them forcefully gives Kamui's users an offensive application.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 598, pages 4-6</ref>\n\nUsing Kamui is the only known way to travel to and from its dimension. This means that targets transferred there are trapped, forced to stay until Kamui's user lets them leave; Obito sometimes uses [[Genjutsu: Sharingan|genjutsu]] on those he imprisons to keep them subdued.<ref name=\"c520\"/> This also makes Kamui's dimension effective as a refuge, as anyone taking shelter there can only be reached by using Kamui.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 666, page 5</ref> But because Obito's two Mangekyō Sharingan spend years with different users – Obito himself and [[Kakashi Hatake]] – this makes Obito and Kakashi essentially immune to each other's Kamui:<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 487, page 4</ref> although one of them can use Kamui on the other, the other can just use Kamui on themselves to escape.<ref name=\"c608\">''Naruto'' chapter 608, page 3-7</ref> This also means they can block or counter each other's attempts to use Kamui on others.<ref name=\"c595\">''Naruto'' chapter 595, pages 12-13</ref>\n\nObito, while in the Purgatory, was able to use Kamui to temporarily return his soul to Earth to continue assisting Kakashi by granting him the use of his Sharingan for a short time.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 688, pages 3-5</ref>\n\n=== Right Eye ===\n[[File:Obito Teleports.png|thumb|left|Obito using Kamui to teleport.]]\nWith Obito's right Mangekyō, a short-range version of Kamui is used. Obito most often uses this version on himself, sucking himself into his right eye to enter Kamui's dimension and then exiting back to whatever location he pleases. Sometimes he does this in order to escape attacks, other times he does this in order to travel long distances. Obito can perform this teleportation at will and doesn't need to designate his destination beforehand,<ref name=\"c395\"/> leading others to label it superior to the [[Flying Thunder God Technique]].<ref name=\"c502\">''Naruto'' chapter 502, page 11-12</ref> Others can be sucked into Kamui's dimension through his eye in addition to or instead of Obito,<ref name=\"c475\">''Naruto'' chapter 475, pages 10-11</ref> and in fact it is faster for him to use Kamui on others than on himself.<ref name=\"c510\">''Naruto'' chapter 510, pages 2-3</ref> Obito is usually shown making physical contact with those he's using Kamui on,<ref name=\"c467\">''Naruto'' chapter 467, pages 6-8</ref> but this isn't always consistent.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 675, pages 1-2</ref>\n\n[[File:Tobi Chains.png|thumb|Obito using Kamui to pass through an opponent.]]\nThe other application of Obito's right Mangekyō, when activated, allows him to turn his body \"intangible\", automatically transferring body parts that otherwise would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into Kamui dimension.<ref name=\"c597\">''Naruto'' chapter 597, pages 4-11</ref> Everything he's touching, including his clothes, weapons and even other people will become intangible too.<ref name=\"c467\"/> Obito often uses this ability defensively, making all attacks pass through him harmlessly;<ref name=\"c597\">''Naruto'' chapter 597, pages 4-11</ref> during early appearances, while using the \"Tobi\" persona, Obito commonly pretended to be hurt or feel pain to confuse opponents.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 357, pages 9-10</ref> Alternatively, Obito uses this ability to pass through [[barrier]]s or other obstacles<ref name=\"c502\"/> and extend the reach of his attacks and ambush his enemies by making his [[Gunbai]] phase through objects.<ref name=\"c595\"/> Obito can even use this ability to travel underground and surprise opponents with attacks from below.<ref name=\"c475\"/>\n\nSince the transfer is done unconsciously, the downside of this technique is that Obito can't physically interact with anything he wasn't in contact with prior to the ability’s activation, forcing him to turn solid if he wishes to engage in combat using taijutsu;<ref name=\"c502\"/> however, it's possible to weave chakra and utilise ninjutsu even while slipping through substance.<ref name=\"c597\"/> The other weaknesses are that Obito can only keep his body slip through for approximately five minutes and as long as his intangibility is activated, he cannot use Kamui for teleportation; in the brief moment between when he solidifies and when he teleports, Obito is vulnerable.<ref name=\"c510\"/> Alternatively, opponents can circumvent his intangibility by transferring themselves or their attacks to Kamui's dimension, which will enable them to damage transported body parts.<ref name=\"c597\"/>\n\nWhile Obito is the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]], he is unable to use Kamui to pass through objects.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 643, page 3</ref>\n\nObito also had an unspecified way of cancelling Kakashi's usage of the left eye's Kamui when he attempted to decapitate the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]], even though he wasn't touching or relatively near the statue.\n\n=== Left Eye ===\n[[File:Kamui.png|thumb|left|Kamui used at a distance.]]\nWith Obito's left Mangekyō, a long-range version of Kamui is used. The user looks at a target and creates a \"barrier space\" around them, with the barrier's size being determined by the user. When the user concentrates, anything within the barrier is pulled towards its centre, transferring the target to Kamui's dimension.<ref name=\"d3\"/> When Kakashi first begins using this version of Kamui, he struggles to perform it with any accuracy, frequently missing his target. Even if he does hit his target, he has difficulty making the barrier space large enough to pull the entire target in.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 276, pages 4-11</ref> In time, he becomes accurate enough to teleport projectiles mid-flight,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 424, pages 16-17</ref> and later can make the barrier space large enough to teleport the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]]'s head.<ref name=\"c595\"/> Additionally, it's viable to transport only selected body parts to mutilate his enemies, inflicting mortal wounds; defence against this is impossible, except by the right eye counterpart to nullify this. Kakashi eventually learns to create the barrier around himself, allowing him to teleport just as Obito does.<ref name=\"c608\"/>\n\nBecause Kakashi is not an [[Uchiha]], using Kamui demands a great deal of chakra for him to perform.<ref name=\"d3\"/> It takes him an extended period of time to gather enough chakra to use it,<ref name=\"c595\"/> and once he does he can only use it so many times before his chakra is depleted;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 281, page 12</ref> originally his limit is three times in a day, but this is later increased to an unspecified number. Similarly, because Kamui is used with a Mangekyō Sharingan, repeated use damages Kakashi's vision, eventually reaching the point where it causes his eyes to bleed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 598, page 12</ref> When Kakashi receives chakra from the [[Nine-Tails]], he is able to use Kamui faster, more often, and on targets as large as the [[Eight-Tails]]; he estimates that the Nine-Tails' chakra makes Kamui three times more powerful than usual.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 617, pages 3-4</ref>\n\n[[Madara Uchiha]] takes Obito's Mangekyō from Kakashi so that he can gain access to Kamui's dimension. Unlike with Obito, being the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki does not prevent Madara from using Kamui.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, page 17</ref>\n\n=== Both Eyes ===\n[[File: Rescuing Sasuke.png|left|thumb|A portal generated by Kamui.]]\nWhen both eyes' Kamui are used on the same target, whether by a single user or two users working together, the teleportation speed is doubled.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 666, pages 13-15</ref> The power of both eyes also grants the user the ability to generate large portals that can allow others to travel through.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 686, page 10</ref>  While Kamui ordinarily only connects its dimension with the [[Geography|Earth]], the user can synchronise Kamui with other space–time ninjutsu, allowing the user to travel to the other ninjutsu's target dimension.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 683, pages 14-15</ref> Opening portals to those other dimensions requires a great deal of chakra, so much that users will likely need another person's assistance.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 685, pages 3-8</ref> \n\n[[File: Obito Teleporting.png|right|thumb|Two Kamui used separately.]]\nThe two powers of Kamui can be used separately, even if to achieve a unified purpose: Obito once used the left Kamui to synchronise with [[Yomotsu Hirasaka]], then used the right Kamui to teleport to its [[Kaguya's Dimensions|associated dimension]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 685, pages 3-4</ref> With the two Mangekyō, users can also perform [[Susanoo]], through which they can create [[Kamui Shuriken]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 689, pages 1-2</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* \"[[Wikipedia:Kamui|Kamui]]\" is the word for a divine being in [[Wikipedia:Ainu|Ainu]] mythology, although it is almost never written with kanji in modern times. In a more general Japanese context, Kamui refers to the might and majesty of the gods, particularly the [[Wikipedia:Shinto|Shintō]] [[Wikipedia:Kami|kami]].\n* Unlike other Mangekyō Sharingan users, Obito's continuous and general usage of Kamui does not seem to deteriorate his eyesight, and likewise does not tire or strain his body. This possibly stemmed from Obito's access to [[Hashirama Senju]]'s cells augmenting his body, similar to them reducing [[Kotoamatsukami]]'s recharge time from 10 years to one day, or extending how long a Sharingan user can keep [[Izanagi]] active.\n* Although teleporting objects from a distance is the left eye's ability, Obito uses the right eye to teleport [[Kaguya]]'s [[All-Killing Ash Bones]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 686, pages 17-19</ref>\n* Occasionally, Obito is depicted using Kamui without activating his Mangekyō Sharingan.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 510, pages 3</ref>\n** This was likely done to prevent tension from building regarding Tobi's identity until just before his identity was revealed rather than being an actual ability of Obito's.\n* In the anime, the [[Hizashi Hyūga]] of ''[[Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero]]'' uses a technique similar to Kamui.\n* The space-time ninjutsu of [[Shin Uchiha]], [[Nue]], [[Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki]] and [[Sarada Uchiha]] are similar in function to Kamui.\n* In ''[[Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker]]'', there are 2 versions of Obito's close-range Kamui: {{translation|Kamui: Sever|神威・絶|Kamui: Zetsu}} for Obito, and {{translation|Kamui: Bonds|神威・紲|Kamui: Setsu}} for Kakashi Hatake (Double Sharingan).\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Daikokuten]]\n* ''[[Ōtsutsuki Teleportation]]''\n* ''[[Sasuke Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]''\n* ''[[Shin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]''\n* [[Yomotsu Hirasaka]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Kamui]]\n[[ru:Камуи]]\n[[id:Kamui]]\n[[fr:Kamui]]\n[[pl:Kamui]]\n[[pt-br:Kamui]]"
