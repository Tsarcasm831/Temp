Despite the technique's dramatic name, it is not actually harmful. The pain is fairly extreme, however, so much so that, when [[Kakashi Hatake]] uses it on [[Naruto Uzumaki]], Naruto comically leaps into the air,<ref name=\"d1\"/> travelling a fair distance. [[Sakura Haruno]] blushes to see it used and [[Sasuke Uchiha]] declares both Kakashi and Naruto \"buffoons\".<ref name=\"c5\"/> The anime shows those who are familiar with One Thousand Years of Death are very unwilling to be subjected to it.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 3</ref> It has no effect on unconscious targets.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 53</ref>\n\nNaruto later uses this technique against [[Gaara]]. Instead of his fingers, Naruto uses a [[kunai]] with an [[exploding tag]] attached. Unlike previous responses to the technique, [[Pakkun]] calls Naruto's attack \"brilliant\".<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 133, pages 7-9</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique's full name is {{translation|\"Konohagakure [[Hiden]] Secret Taijutsu Technique: One Thousand Years of Death\"|木ノ葉隠れ秘伝体術奥義・千年殺し|Konohagakure Hiden Taijutsu Ōgi: Sennen Goroshi|engtv=Hidden Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu: One Thousand Years of Death|viz=Konohagakure's Most Secret and Sacred Technique: One Thousand Years of Death|ukdvd=Secret Ninja Technique of the Hidden Leaf School, Death for 1000 Years|''English Games'' \"Sacred Taijutsu: 1000 Years of Death\"}}.\n* The official name for this technique is ''Sennen Goroshi''. However, the name is sometimes thought erroneously to be {{translation|''Sennen Gurushi''|千年苦し}}, meaning something along the lines of \"Thousand Years of Pain\".\n* This technique is modelled after the [[Wikipedia:Kancho|Kanchō]], a Japanese prank common among children.\n* In chapter 5 of ''[[Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles]]'', [[Sakumo Hatake]] is said to be a user of the technique. At the end of the chapter, Kakashi, [[Might Guy]], and [[Rock Lee]] perform a collaboration technique they call  {{translation|\"[[w:c:springtimeofyouth:Three Thousand Years of Death|Three Thousand Years of Death]]\"|三千年殺し|San Sennen Goroshi}}.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[id:Seribu Tahun Kematian]]\n[[es:Mil Años de Muerte]]\n[[fr:1000 Ans de Souffrances]]\n[[pl:Sennen Goroshi]]\n[[tr:Bin Yıllık Ölüm]]"
