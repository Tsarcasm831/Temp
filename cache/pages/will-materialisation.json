In an attempt to retrieve the chakra bestowed upon her [[Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki|two]] [[Hamura Ōtsutsuki|sons]], she imparted her will upon the [[God Tree]] and  — along with all the people tethered to it —  created what then became the [[Ten-Tails]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 681, page 9</ref> Titanic in size, she was able to use its power to fight her children for a length of months.\n\nImmediately prior to being [[Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei|sealed]] by Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki formulated a plan that would result in her eventual revival. To accomplish this, she created a sentient being known as [[Black Zetsu]], which would spend centuries fulfilling her desire.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 678, pages 14-16</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 681, page 8</ref> Created as a malleable construct, Black Zetsu is capable of controlling the actions of others by [[Body Coating|coating]] itself over their bodies and taking possession of them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 656, page 16</ref> Once the [[Tailed Beasts|remnants]] of her chakra were finally [[Ten-Tails|reunited]], Black Zetsu was able to revive her within a new host, Madara Uchiha. It was also capable of manipulating the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path|husk]] of the Ten-Tails, extracting a number of [[White Zetsu]] from it.\n\n=== Madara Uchiha ===\nMadara Uchiha was also capable of using this ability. Moments prior to his death, he attempted to infuse his will into the right half of White Zetsu, seemingly creating Black Zetsu, which he referred to as a weaker version of himself; in actuality, Black Zetsu merely made it look like it was being created as part of its plan. \n\nMadara was actually able to impart his will into the [[Black Receiver|black rod]] that emerged from the [[Hashirama's Artificial Body|flowering tree]] he was attached to in his old age. Revealing it to [[Obito]], Madara claimed that it was a physical manifestation of his will and that it should be used when performing the [[Six Paths Technique]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 606, pages 15-16</ref>\n\nOn a later occasion, following his [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|resurrection]], Madara caused a number of these black rods to emerge from Obito's artificial right half, which became entirely coated in a black substance similar to Black Zetsu.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 636, pages 15-17</ref> This allowed Madara to remotely control Obito's actions using his [[chakra]], as well as fire black rods out of his body as projectiles, though Obito was ultimately able to resist his control.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 637</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Matérialisation de la Volonté]]\n[[pl:Materializacja Woli]]"
