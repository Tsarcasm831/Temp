Then, using his extreme strength, he smashes them head first onto the ground in what resembles a powerbomb manoeuvre. This is devastating enough to shatter a large area of the ground itself on impact. [[Darui]] noted that nobody has ever survived this attack before, and had [[Sasuke Uchiha]] not used his [[Susanoo]] to cushion the impact, he would have been killed by it. The impact of this technique was strong enough to snap the ribs of Sasuke's Susanoo.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 463, pages 6-7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* As with many of the techniques of [[Kumogakure]] [[shinobi]], this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as ''Raiga Bakudan''.\n* \"Liger Bomb\" is also the name of an attack used in professional wrestling, most notably by [[Wikipedia:Jushin Liger|Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger]]. A Liger Bomb is, a sit down variation, of the common [[Wikipedia:Powerbomb|powerbomb]]. The nintaijustu used by [[Fourth Raikage|A]] is the same manoeuvre [[wikipedia:Dave Bautista|Batista]] utilises as his finisher, calling it the \"Batista Bomb\".\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Bomba Ligera]]\n[[fr:Déflagration Fulgurante]]\n[[pl:Raigā Bomu]]"
