The clones can be as simple in function as a wooden dummy for use in the [[Body Replacement Technique]] or completely mobile and able to perform [[jutsu]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 288, page 11</ref> They have the ability to travel far from the user and are able to communicate with the original. Moreover, since the wood clone has the ability to merge with plants and trees, it is also great for reconnaissance missions.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 300, page 14</ref> By directly touching the wood clone with his hand, the user can change the shape of the clone.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 301, page 14</ref> \n\nUnlike other [[clone techniques]], the wood clone doesn't disappear when hit and takes the damage to a certain degree. This, according to [[Madara Uchiha]], makes it the perfect clone technique that only he with his [[dōjutsu]] was able to see through.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 577 pages 10-11</ref> Wood clones are also somewhat inhibited by the actions of the user, so if they are preoccupied with other tasks the wood clones will not be able to act to their full potential.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 636, page 14</ref> Wood clones can, however, be dispelled like normal clones.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 638, page 13</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When Madara used this technique, he called it a {{translation|\"''Wood Release Clone''\"|木遁分身|Mokuton Bunshin}}.<ref name=\"madara\"/>\n* When Hashirama used this technique, he called it {{translation|\"''Wood Release: Wood Clone Technique''\"|木遁・木分身の術|Mokuton: Moku Bunshin no Jutsu}}.<ref name=\"hashirama\"/>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Transmission Wood]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Clone Ligneux]]\n[[pl:Moku Bunshin no Jutsu]]"
