He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll. From the scroll, more than a hundred [[puppet]]s wearing red cloaks emerge.\n\nAs even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the [[Puppet Technique]]. Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response. However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.\n\nSasori stated that he brought down an entire country (the [[Land of This]] in the anime) with this technique. Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with [[Chiyo]] and [[Sakura Haruno]], although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's [[White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets]]. While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents. Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets. \n\nAs with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special [[poison]], which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.\n\nIn the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside [[Hiruko]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 310</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, two of the puppets are briefly shown with the [[Sharingan]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 26 — 13:28, 16:24</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu Secreto Rojo: Aparición de las Cien Marionetas]]\n[[fr:Arcanes Rouges - Théâtre des 100 Pantins]]\n[[pl:Akahigi: Hyakki no Sōen]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Vermelha Secreta: Performance das Cem Marionetes]]\n[[ru:Красная секретная игра: Танец ста марионеток]]"
