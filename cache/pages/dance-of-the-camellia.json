With it he repeatedly stabs at his target, doing so rapidly enough to create the appearance of afterimages. Each stab is directed at a slightly different part of the target, from a slightly different angle, and with slightly different regularity, making it difficult to predict each strike. Although targets may be able to dodge Kimimaro's attacks for a time, they will eventually be unable to keep up with the constant and \"chaotic\" strikes, giving Kimimaro the opening he needs to finally stab and kill them.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[wikipedia:camellia|Camellia]]s are tall evergreen trees that grow in warm regions.
