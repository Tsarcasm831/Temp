It was shown that this line of ninjutsu allows Utakata to create bubbles with an explosive composition that he can manipulate to attack the enemy. These bubbles can either burst on their own or on Utakata's command.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 564, pages 5-6</ref> Utakata was also capable of combining acid with his soap bubble ninjutsu.<ref>Fourth Databook, page 37</ref>\n\nIn the anime, it is shown to be extremely versatile: Utakata can float inside his bubbles for transport, as well as use them offensively by trapping his enemies in them and filling the bubbles with water to drown them. These bubbles can also be filled with different materials, such as blinding powder, smoke, acid or sticky slime. It was also shown that Utakata's master carried a bubble blower with him as well, hinting that he also used this form of ninjutsu.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 145</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In video games, Saiken is able to generate the same type of bubbles from its mouth.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Bubblegum Ninjutsu]]\n* [[Water Balloon Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Ninjutsu des Bulles de Savon]]\n[[pl:Shabondama no Ninjutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Ninjutsu de Bolha de Sabão]]\n[[ru:Ниндзюцу Мыльных Пузырей]]"
