It was a technique designed by Ōnoki to protect the [[Iwagakure|village]] from attackers while lowering the number of casualties.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Akuta creates living organisms made of clay<ref>''Boruto'' episode 88</ref> that are weaponised. They are able to phase through the earthen ground for travel and drag their enemies with them, as well as extend their limbs.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 82</ref> While they have no fear, they have a limited lifespan and intelligence, being capable of obeying instructions and communicating with [[fabrication]]s.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 89</ref> Their masks are their weakness, the destruction of which would lead to their deaths.\n\nWhile deemed to have no will, this was proven false in [[Akkun]]'s existence, a small Akuta who gained affection to [[Inojin Yamanaka]], and even defied its comrades to protect him. [[Kirara]] deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits. When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against Ōnoki's orders.\n\n== Development ==\nŌnoki created this technique in response to a [[missing-nin]]'s attack claiming the lives of many young [[shinobi]]. When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led [[Kurotsuchi]] to reject the technique's further development. Despite this, Ōnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.\n\nIwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced. It was later destroyed by [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Species]]\n[[fr:Akuta]]\n[[pt-br:Akuta]]\n[[ru:Акута]]\n[[pl:Akuta]]"
