Because it is transmitted via sound, it is effective against long ranges, working even on those whose location the user does not know. Whoever hears the flute is subjected to an illusion of their limbs being bound, preventing them from being able to move. They are also subjected to morbid visions, weakening them mentally until they finally lose consciousness.<ref name=\"d2\"/> When [[Tayuya]] performs this with her [[Demonic Flute]] against [[Shikamaru Nara]], Shikamaru envisions himself on a barren landscape strewn with partial skeletons, his arms and legs restrained by ropes suspended from the ceiling. In the manga, he is forced to watch as his flesh seemingly melts from his bones;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 208</ref> in the anime, it is the entire limb that melts, bone and all.\n\nHowever, the sound can be blown away by powerful [[Wind Release]] techniques. Tayuya acknowledges Wind Release users are her natural enemy because of this.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 213</ref>\n\nAfter acquiring Tayuya's DNA, [[Kabuto Yakushi]] is able use this technique through his [[Strange Transmission Distant Shadow]].
