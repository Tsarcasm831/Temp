The technique is considered to be a flawless [[Transformation Technique]] as even the copied person's allies won't be able to tell the difference, and [[ninken]] would not smell a different scent. Though the user copies the person's face and body, they can't use their techniques or unique abilities, and they are also very weak to attack. In order to copy an appearance, the user needs to wear a special mask and stay close to the target for a long time. When the technique commences, the user's eyes begin to glow. The transformation lasts only a few days and is unique to the [[Kedōin clan]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Shadow Mirror Body Changing Method]]\n* [[Substitute Technique]]\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Copiado Facial]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Cópia de Rosto]]\n[[pl:Kao Utsushi no Jutsu]]"
