This technique can be set up as a feint as it has a delayed activation. The technique alters weather conditions temporarily and attacks from the sky rather than from the person. The storm clouds that create the attack dissipate immediately after the tornado begins while the tornado continues in a highly concentrated state.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The name of this technique and with its localised name in mind, is likely a play on the term {{translation|\"Tatsu no Otoshigo\"|竜の落し子|lit meaning=the dragon's bastard or fallen child}}, which is often used as a term for a seahorse or any similar species (as in Asian cultures, they were deemed to be a discarded dragon's offspring).\n\n[[fr:Fûton - Grande Coupe du Dragon]]\n[[pl:Fūton: Tatsu no Ōshigoto]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Vento: Grande Tarefa do Dragão]]"
