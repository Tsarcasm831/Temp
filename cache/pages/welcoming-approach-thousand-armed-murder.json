The technique is activated when the user takes a specific stance with their left hand making a half-ram and then extending their right hand down with his palm parallel to the ground. Once the stance is taken, the spirit of the Thousand-Armed [[Wikipedia:Guanyin|Kannon]] is summoned to defend the user, or attack their enemies. The spirit is normally calm, angelic and looks peaceful. However, whenever the user gets angry, the spirit turns red and transforms into a demonic-looking creature. Kannon then attacks the user's target with its 1000 spirit fists. The size and power of the spirit is dependent upon the skill of the user.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although the spirit appearing with this technique is the bodhisattva Kannon, the [[Wikipedia:Raigō|''Welcoming Approach'']] refers to the appearance of the [[Wikipedia:Amitābha|Amida Buddha]] at the time of one's death, welcoming the nearly-departed into the [[Wikipedia:Pure land|Pure Land]]. However, images of this Welcoming Approach often depict the Amida Buddha sitting on a purple cloud flanked by Kannon and [[Wikipedia:Mahasthamaprapta|Seishi]], another bodhisattva. These three form a kind of trinity, especially revered in Pure Land Buddhism.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Eighty Gods Vacuum Attack]]\n* [[Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands]]\n* [[Top Transformed Buddha]]\n\n[[pt-br:Abordagem Acolhedora: Mil Braços Assassinos]]\n[[pl:Raigō: Senjusatsu]]\n[[fr:Raigô_-_Assassinat_aux_Mille_Bras]]"
