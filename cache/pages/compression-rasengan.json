In this state, it can penetrate targets with little resistance. Even if the impact is reduced by a strong defence to the point of making it non-lethal, it can still knock out powerful opponents. At the same time, its compressed nature can cause severe recoil, greatly straining the user's arm, making it dangerous to use often.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 181</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Runt Ball Rasengan]]\n* [[Mini-Rasenshuriken]]\n* [[Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[pl:Asshuku Rasengan]]\n[[ru:Сжатый Расенган]]\n[[tr:Sıkıştırılmış Rasengan]]"
