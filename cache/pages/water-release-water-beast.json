The beast can launch powerful streams of water from its mouth, or sweep the area with its claws to let a powerful torrent of water to wash the enemies away.\n\nWhen Kakashi used this technique against [[Shabadaba]]'s guards at his palace, he manipulated the water at the fountain, which was yellow. He managed to keep the water beast active for a long time, and combined it with his [[Sharingan]] to keep track of his enemies, which tired him out at the end.\n\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Água: Besta de Água]]"
