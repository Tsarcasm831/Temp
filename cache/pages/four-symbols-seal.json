The user applies the seal's formula to an object or a human's body, sealing a large enemy or an evil spirit within them.<ref name=\"d1\"/> If two Four Symbols Seal are used, a stronger seal is created; this is called the [[Eight Trigrams Sealing Style]]. If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's [[chakra]] to merge with whoever they've been sealed into. This is how the [[Nine-Tails]] was sealed into the body of [[Naruto Uzumaki]].<ref>''[[Rin no Sho]]'', page 216</ref>\n\nThe Four Symbols Seal is based on the [[fūinjutsu]] of [[Uzushiogakure]]'s [[Uzumaki clan]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 500, page 3</ref> According to [[Killer B]], it is stronger than the [[Iron Armour Seal]] used to seal the [[Eight-Tails]] within him.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 496, page 7</ref> The Four Symbols Seal is also left on the stomachs of those who perform the [[Dead Demon Consuming Seal]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 123, page 13</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 504, page 6</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique has the opposite effect of the [[Reverse Four Symbols Sealing]].\n* In the manga, after [[Tailed Beast Transfer Technique|transferring]] [[Kurama]]'s Yin-half into an incapacitated Naruto Uzumaki, [[Obito Uchiha]] was also shown reestablishing the former's [[Eight Trigrams Sealing Style|two]] Four Symbols Seals.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 666, page 16</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Orochimaru]] suited [[Mecha-Naruto]] with two Four Symbols Seals in order to take the Nine-Tails from Naruto.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 376</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Uzumaki clan| ]]\n\n[[de:Shishou Fuuin]]\n[[fr:Sceau des Quatre Symboles]]\n[[id:Segel 4 Simbol]]\n[[pl:Shishō Fūin]]\n[[pt-br:Selo de Quatro Símbolos]]"
