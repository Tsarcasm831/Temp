When [[Rock Lee]] performs it against [[Sasuke Uchiha]], he starts with a backwards high kick using his left foot, the motion of which then helps him deliver a low kick with his right. Although the first kick is damaging on its own, it's primarily intended as a distraction, forcing Sasuke to block it and thus rendering him vulnerable to the second kick.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nWhen Lee uses Leaf Whirlwind against [[Kimimaro]], he performs it more akin to [[Dynamic Entry]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 209</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Some ''Naruto'' media have confused what \"Leaf Whirlwind\" is. Video games from the [[Naruto: Clash of Ninja (series)|''Naruto: Clash of Ninja'' series]], for instance, use its name for moves that more closely resemble [[Leaf Strong Whirlwind]]. The English anime has at times also used the same translation (\"Leaf Hurricane\") for both Leaf Whirlwind and [[Leaf Gale]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Takigakure Whirlwind]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Remolino de la Hoja]]\n[[fr:Tornade de Konoha]]\n[[pl:Konoha Senpū]]\n[[pt-br:Furacão da Folha]]"
