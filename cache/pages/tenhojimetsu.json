Sasuke [[Chibaku Tensei|traps the opponent in a giant meteorite]], but Madara tries one-upping him by [[Tengai Shinsei|summoning a larger meteorite]] above Sasuke's technique to crash into it, declaring that he alone is sufficient for the job. He is interrupted when Indra [[Heavenly Lightning|shatters both meteorites with a lightning bolt]], and retorts that both of their jutsu are the same to him. Refusing to be outdone, Sasuke flies into the air and calls them both pathetic before calling a [[Kirin]] coated in [[Amaterasu|black flames]] down upon the battlefield, finishing the opponent in a huge explosion."
