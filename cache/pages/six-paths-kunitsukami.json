Asura is able to equip the avatar with [[Truth-Seeking Ball]]s that can be used as a means of offence, or the avatar can serve as a defensive structure, similar to Indra's Susanoo.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While unnamed in the manga and anime, this technique was named in ''[[Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu]]''.\n* In [[Wikipedia:Shinto|Shinto]], the {{translation|Kunitsukami|国津神}} are the [[Wikipedia:Kami|deities]] of the earthly realm, in contrast to the {{translation|Amatsukami|天津神}} of heaven.\n* This technique's appearance is a reference to Asura's namesake, the [[Wikipedia:Asura|Asuras]] of Hindu and Buddhist mythology, which are often depicted with three faces and six arms.\n* Using the [[Shadow Clone Technique]] in conjunction with his [[Tailed Beast Mode]], [[Naruto Uzumaki]] was able to create a similar chakra avatar by merging three [[Kurama]] avatars into one construct.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 696</ref>\n* Despite having seemingly no relation to Kurama, Kunitsukami also has nine tails.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Rikudô - Kunitsukami]]\n[[pl:Rikudō: Kunitsukami]]\n[[pt-br:Seis Caminhos: Kunitsukami]]"
