In one instance of use, Minato and Tobirama used this technique to take [[Obito Uchiha]] by surprise on the battlefield where Minato — who was originally struck by an [[Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero|attack]] — switched places with Tobirama to cause the attack to land on their intended target.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Because of the way that Tobirama and Minato had intended to use this technique to take Obito by surprise, Minato noted that their [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation#Enhancements|immortal]] bodies would be beneficial to them.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Amenotejikara]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Échange du Dieu de la Foudre]]\n[[pl:Hiraishin Goshun Mawashi no Jutsu]]"
