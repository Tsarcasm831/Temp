To do this, the user has to be emitting a constant stream of chakra from the bottom of their feet and using the repellent force to walk across the water's surface. This technique is more difficult to master than the [[Tree Climbing Practice]], because the amount of chakra that needs to be emitted changes constantly.\n\nIt has also been shown that one can use their chakra to \"''skate''\" across the water surface, like an [[Wikipedia:Ice skating|ice skater]], instead of just walking or running. As [[Jiraiya]] noted, the more one trains this technique, the more they reach a state where they stand on water without even noticing it or basically even trying.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 14</ref> Furthermore, this technique allows its users to walk on [[Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field|sticky surfaces]] without being affected.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 326, page 8</ref>\n\nIt doesn't have to just be at the feet. A user under water can focus chakra on their hands or any other body part that makes contact with the water's surface. If they were submerged, they can climb atop the water as if they were climbing out of a pool.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Naruto Terms]]\n[[fr:Exercice de Marche sur la Surface de l'Eau]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Caminhada Aquática]]\n[[ru:Дзюцу хождения по воде]]\n[[pl:Suimen Hokō no Gyō]]"
