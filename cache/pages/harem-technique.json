The naked forms swarm their target and hang upon them, the intention being to overpower targets with lustful thoughts.<ref name=\"d1\"/> [[Ebisu]], against whom the Sexy Technique was ineffective, is defeated by the Harem Technique, losing consciousness due to a bloody nose. The [[Third Hokage]], who previously fell prey to the Sexy Technique, suspects the Harem Technique would also work against him.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 2</ref> [[Killer B]] is unmoved by it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 492</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, the naked forms are obscured by heavier amounts of smoke than is used in the Harem Technique's manga depictions.\n** ''Naruto'' video games take the additional step of having all the shadow clones wearing swimsuits.\n* In ''Naruto'' episode 193, [[Naruto]] instead has his shadow clones [[transform]] into (fully clothed) [[Sakura Haruno]]s, taking advantage of [[Rock Lee]]'s feelings for her.\n* In ''Naruto'' chapter 492, Naruto's fringes when using this jutsu are styled different than the usual. This style was never used again, nor was it adapted into the anime in ''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 243.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Technique du Harem]]\n[[id:Teknik Harem]]\n[[pl:Hāremu no Jutsu]]\n[[ru:Техника Гарема]]"
