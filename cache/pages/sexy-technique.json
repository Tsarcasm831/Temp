In some anime episodes and in ''Naruto'' video games, the user instead takes the form of a woman wearing a swimsuit.\n** In \"[[The New Erotic Ninjutsu Completed!!]]\", instead of turning into a naked woman, Naruto transforms into a woman wearing a revealing devil outfit. Jiraiya's desire for Naruto to take a form with even skimpier clothing leads Naruto create a [[New Sexy Technique|\"new\" Sexy Technique]].\n* A similar transformation appeared in the [[Naruto Manga Pilot|pilot chapter]] of ''Naruto''.\n* In ''[[Hyō no Sho]]'', [[Iruka Umino]] rates the Sexy Technique as having an Impact of 4/5, Creativity of 5/5, and Annoyance of 1/5.<ref>''[[Hyō no Sho]]'', page 156</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[ru:Техника Соблазнения]]\n[[id:Teknik Seksi]]\n[[fr:Sexy-Méta]]\n[[pl:Oiroke no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Sexy]]"
