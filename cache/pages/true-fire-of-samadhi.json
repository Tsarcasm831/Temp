Regarded as the {{Translation|\"Flames of Purgatory\"|煉獄の炎|Rengoku no Honō}},<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 23, page 17</ref> they are said to be inextinguishable by wind or rain, and burn so quickly that regenerative techniques cannot keep up with them, leaving the victim's body completely charred in mere moments. The flames can, however, be absorbed and sealed away.\n\n== Influence ==\nThe jutsu is named after and inspired by the True Samādhi Fire (Chinese: 三昧眞火, ''Sānmèi Zhēnhuǒ'') featured in the Chinese classical novel ''[[Wikipedia:Journey to the West|Journey to the West]]''. In the novel, the character [[Wikipedia:Red Boy|Red Boy]] (Chinese: 紅孩兒, ''Hóng hái'ér'') developed the ability to create True Samādhi Fire after 300 years of self-cultivation on the Flaming Mountains. This magical fire proved inextinguishable, with heavy rainfall summoned by the Dragon Kings only intensifying Red Boy's blaze, as if the water were oil. Even the Monkey King was almost burned to death by the True Samādhi Fire.\n\n==Trivia== \n*\"[[Wikipedia:Samadhi|Samādhi]]\" refers to a state of meditative consciousness. It is the last of the eight elements of the [[Wikipedia:Noble Eightfold Path|Noble Eightfold Path]] which is an early summary of the path of Buddhist practices leading to liberation from the painful cycle of rebirth.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Amaterasu]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Zanmai no Shinka]]\n[[es:Fuego de la Verdad Samadhi]]\n[[fr:Véritable Feu de Samadhi]]\n[[it:Zanmai no Shinka]]\n[[pl:Zanmai no Shinka]]\n[[pt-br:Verdadeiras Chamas de Samadhi]]\n[[ru:Пламя Истины Самадхи]]"
