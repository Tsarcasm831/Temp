When the user is struck by a physical attack, the impacted area becomes liquid, causing the attack to pass through them and leave them unharmed. The user then solidifies back into their original form.<ref name=\"d3\"/> This technique is generally autonomous, allowing for members to liquefy without conscious thought.\n\nIn addition to defence, Hōzuki can convert their body into liquid for any number of purposes, such as infiltrating buildings or sneaking up on targets;<ref name=\"d3\"/> the anime depicts users camouflaging themselves for the latter purpose.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 29</ref> They can [[Water Release: Great Water Arm Technique|pump water into their muscle]]s to increase their strength,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 348, page 15</ref> [[Water Gun Technique|shoot water]] from their fingers as an attack,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 556, page 9</ref> or use their bodies to douse targets.<ref name=\"c556\"/> Despite the versatility of their liquid states, it renders Hōzuki very vulnerable to [[Lightning Release]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 463, page 10</ref> If an attack overwhelms a user and they pass out, their unconscious body will take on a jelly-like state.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 414, page 15</ref> If a Hōzuki is captured and placed inside a sealed container, they will be unable to move or escape.<ref name=\"d3\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|\"Suika\"|水化}} is the Japanese term for \"hydration\", but separately, the kanji mean {{translation|\"water\"|水}} and {{translation|\"to become\"|化}} respectively, translating to something more similar to \"hydrification\" (\"to become water\"). This explains the effect of this technique more precisely.\n* By researching [[Suigetsu Hōzuki]]'s body, [[Kabuto Yakushi]] creates a similar defensive skill that he uses by coating his body with bodily fluids.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 579, page 11</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Earth Release: Mud Body Technique]]''\n* ''[[Iburi Clan's Kekkei Genkai]]''\n* ''[[Sand Body]]''\n* [[Water Replacement]]\n* ''[[Water Release: Water Body]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu de Hidratación]]\n[[fr:Technique de Liquéfaction]]\n[[pl:Suika no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Hidratação]]"
