Doing so greatly increases range and destructive power. The lion heads drain the chakra network of those they touch. It is an extremely difficult ability to learn, as the slightest mistake in chakra control will lead to failure, meaning it is a feat requiring the [[Byakugan]]. This technique can be used in conjunction with the [[Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms]].\n\n== Development ==\nIn the anime, it is shown that during some time in Part II after learning from [[Ino]] of [[Naruto]]'s [[Wind Release: Rasenshuriken|new technique]], Hinata trained with [[Neji]] to develop her own. By expelling chakra from the [[tenketsu]] as an innate ability exclusive to the Hyūga, and using precise chakra control, Hinata was able to shape the chakra around her fists in the form of blue guardian lions, as witnessed by both Neji and [[Hanabi]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 390</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles]]'', Hinata can use this technique in conjunction with the [[Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms]].\n* In certain games, Hinata can use this technique as a ranged attack by launching the chakra lions directly at her opponent.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Paso Suave Doble Puño de León]]\n[[pt-br:Passo Suave: Punhos dos Leões Gêmeos]]\n[[pl:Jūho Sōshiken]]\n[[fr:Paumes Jumelles des Lions Agiles]]"
