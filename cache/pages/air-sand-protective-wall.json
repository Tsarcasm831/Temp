By gathering the best possible mineral-rich sand, the hardness of the shield is considered to be very high. \n\nFurthermore, the sand has its defensive strength raised by flowing chakra through it. It was strong enough to protect [[Sunagakure]] from [[Deidara]]'s [[C3]], and stop a [[Earth Release: Super Light-Weight Rock Technique|lightened]] [[Tengai Shinsei]].\n\nIn the ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'', Gaara uses this technique in conjunction with [[wind]]-natured [[chakra]], creating multiple giant sand shields, to protect his village from a falling meteor.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Kūsa, when written as 空佐, is a rank in the Japan Air Self-Defence Force. It is about equivalent to the rank of Colonel.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Protección de Cielo Pared de Arena]]\n[[fr:Mur Aérien de Sable]]\n[[pl:Kūsa Bōheki]]\n[[pt-br:Muro Defensivo de Areia Aérea]]"
