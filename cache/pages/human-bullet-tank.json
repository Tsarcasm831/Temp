Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,<ref name=\"d1\"/> increasing the damage when they fall back to the ground. The speed at which they spin has the added benefit of rendering most attacks ineffective against them.<ref name=\"c70\"/> But the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction and thus leaving them vulnerable while they do.<ref name=\"c87\">''Naruto'' chapter 87</ref>\n\nHow the Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes. In Part I, when [[Chōji Akimichi]]'s Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.<ref name=\"c87\"/> In Part II, when Chōji's Multi-Size Technique simply makes him large, he folds his legs to his chest and locks his arms around them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 333</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The full name of this technique is {{translation|Leaf-Style Taijutsu: Human Bullet Tank|木ノ葉流体術・肉弾戦車|Konoha-Ryū Taijutsu: Nikudan Sensha|lit meaning=Tree Leaf-Style Body Technique: Human Bullet Tank}}.\n* In the anime, [[Nagare]] modelled his [[Assimilation: Rock Tank]] after this technique.\n* [[Neji]] uses a [[w:c:springtimeofyouth:Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven: Human Bullet Tank|similar technique]] in ''[[Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles]]''.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Akimichi clan| ]]\n\n[[es:Bola de Tanque Humano]]\n[[fr:Boulet Humain]]\n[[pt-br:Tanque da Bala Humana]]\n[[pl:Nikudan Sensha]]"
