The barrier also prevents those outside of it from [[Sensor Type|sensing]] anything inside it through traditional methods.\n\nThe users can erect as much as 36 barriers, with the highest number being able to stop and contain any individual [[jinchūriki]]. It proved to be strong enough to take a direct [[Tailed Beast Ball]] from [[Killer B]], with only nine of the thirty-six barriers shattering. However, [[Naruto Uzumaki]] transformed into his [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode]] and forced the Tailed Beast Ball to push the rest of the way through with B following, showing it could not withstand the assault of two jinchūriki.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The technique required the combined chakra of six individuals.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Barrera de las Treinta y Seis Capas Autorreparables]]\n[[fr:Barrière Auto-Régénérante]]\n[[pl:Saisei Kekkai]]"
