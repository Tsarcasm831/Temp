This gives him the advantage of short range attacks, and because the dragon is completely composed of smoke, physical attacks are useless against it. He could also form several smoke dragons at once. Its primary battle ability is to envelop and suffocate the target. However, as smoke is dissolved when it comes into contact with water, this technique is weak against [[Water Release|water-based]] attacks.\n\n[[pl:Enryū]]"
