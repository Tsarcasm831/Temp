The user creates a rift, which allows anyone enveloped to transfer to a chosen location including foreign dimensions. The rift's formation is fast enough to catch targets off guard and transport them alongside the user, as well as to evade attacks from enemies at the last moment.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 37, pages 6-9, 40</ref>\n\nAn Ōtsutsuki can synchronise the technique to a recipient of their [[Kāma]], allowing the member to transport themselves to the host's location through the mark.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 36, pages 20-22</ref> Two Kāma recipients can collaboratively manifest the rift from their marks to bypass [[fūinjutsu]].<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 39, page 33</ref> Even if the target recipient does not possess Kāma, if the user can track down the chakra of the target, it is possible for them to create the rift to drag said target to their location, as Isshiki teleported Kawaki via Naruto's chakra, which was being used to powerup the latter's artificial arm.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 52, page 38-41</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While being controlled by [[Isshiki Ōtsutsuki]], [[Jigen]]'s body could perform this technique.\n* In the anime, each rift is shown to have a variation in colour. Jigen and Kawaki's are red, while Boruto's is blue.\n* After Amado restored his Kāma, Kawaki has created a rift without activating the Kāma, instead seemingly using it through the [[Kokugan]].\n* A White Kāma user cannot use this technique.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Kamui]]\n* ''[[Sasuke Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]''\n* ''[[Shin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]\n* [[Yomotsu Hirasaka]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Téléportation d'Ôtsutsuki]]\n[[pl:Teleportacja Ōtsutsuki]]\n[[ru:Разлом Камы]]"
