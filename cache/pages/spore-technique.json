As these clones [[Chakra Absorption Techniques|parasitise]] their victim's [[chakra]] and have no chakra of their own, they cannot be detected by [[Sensing Technique|standard sensory abilities]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 469, page 2</ref> Once activated via time-delay, the parasite clones suddenly expand, restricting their victim's movements and stealing greater amounts of chakra.\n\nThe absorbed chakra can be [[Chakra Transfer Technique|transferred]] to another individual by establishing physical contact with them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 466, pages 9-11</ref> The spores can also activate in order to shield their host from harm,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 486, page 3</ref> or be forced into activation and expelled from their host's body if that individual takes in [[senjutsu]] chakra.<ref name=\"ch618\">''Naruto'' chapter 618, page 12</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Although the spores are usually undetectable, [[Orochimaru]] and [[Kabuto Yakushi]] are able to notice their presence due to extensive research on [[Hashirama Senju]]'s DNA.<ref name=\"ch618\"/>\n* In the anime and official digitally coloured manga, the clones grown through this technique at the [[Kage Summit]] were depicted as being entirely white in colour.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 204</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Espora]]\n[[fr:Technique des Spores]]\n[[pl:Hōshi no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Esporos]]"
