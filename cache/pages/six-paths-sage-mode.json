The original Japanese supports both translations, and in fact could intend for both meanings to be true.\n* In ''[[Shikamaru Hiden]]'', it is suggested that having the chakra of all nine [[tailed beast]]s is also a requirement to obtain this mode.\n* In the colourised versions of chapters [[The Infinite Dream|676]] and [[My Will Is|678]] included in digital editions of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'', Naruto's eyes in this mode were depicted with orange irides, much like his previous transformations. Later illustrations coloured by [[Masashi Kishimoto]] instead depict Naruto with yellow irides. The colouration was corrected in subsequent chapters and the ''[[Naruto: Colour Edition]]'' release of [[Naruto and the Sage of Six Paths…!! (volume)|volume 71]].\n* In VIZ Shonen Jump, Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode was attributed to the [[Six Paths Yang Power]]. However, this is not mentioned in the manga or the databooks.\n* In ''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations'' chapter 52, Naruto asked about the difference between \"Baryon Mode\" and \"Kurama Mode and Sage of Six Paths Mode\" to Kurama. It is suggested that he was using the latter forms when he fought [[Isshiki Ōtsutsuki]].\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Modo Sabio de los Seis Caminos]]\n[[fr:Mode Ermite de Rikudô]]\n[[id:Mode Petapa Enam Jalan]]\n[[pl:Rikudō Sennin Mōdo]]\n[[pt-br:Modo Sábio dos Seis Caminhos]]\n[[ru:Режим Мудреца Шести Путей]]"
