Under his command, the bubble will take him wherever he wishes. It's seemingly very capable of both travelling very long distances and floating rather high into the air with no apparent risk of popping. Utakata can also make the bubble camouflage to hide from anyone who's after him. Utakata is also able to take people with him via this technique. Smaller bubbles were seen floating casually alongside it, whereas the first time it was shown, it was just the one bubble. Upon bursting the bubble to get out of it, Utakata can use it do damage nearby opponents.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While unnamed in the anime, this technique was explicitly named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]''.\n* In ''[[Naruto Mobile]]'', [[Yurui]] uses a similar ability, encasing the opponent in a [[Bubblegum Ninjutsu|huge bubble of bubblegum]], inside which he floats above the ground, although not as high as Utakata is capable of. Yurui's bubble also explodes when necessary.\n\n[[es:Jutsu Burbuja Flotante]]\n[[fr:Suiton - Bulles Explosives - Dérive]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Hōmatsu no Jutsu Hyō]]"
