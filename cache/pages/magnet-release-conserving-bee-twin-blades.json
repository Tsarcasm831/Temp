However, the magnetic force weakens from object to object. Once a person has been magnetised, the user can manipulate the magnetic field in such a manner as to make any subsequent attack using a metallic weapon impossible to evade.\n\n[[Toroi]] uses his Magnet Release to magnetise a large quantity of [[shuriken]], which he then throws in the direction of his opponents. Any individual that comes into direct contact with these shuriken themselves are magnetised; as such, it is crucial that the opponent avoids all of them as even a single deflection will result in the production of a powerful [[Wikipedia:Magnetic field|magnetic field]] around their body. \n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Object Manipulation Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Magnético: Conservación de Abeja de Hojas Gemelas]]\n[[fr:Jiton - Shuriken Magnétique]]\n[[pl:Jiton: Jakuhō no Sōjin]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Magnetismo: Lâminas Gêmeas das Vespas Omissas]]"
