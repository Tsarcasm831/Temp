Through the use of chakra flow, the user channels their [[chakra]] through their swords, extending both the reach and cutting ability of the blade, while allowing the user to [[Flash|fire crescents of chakra]] whenever the blade is swung. This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles completely penetrated a considerable stone pillar, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings.\n\nThe samurai have also shown the ability to use [[Shape Transformation|shape transformation]] during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords, [[Wikipedia:Seven-Branched Sword|spiked shafts]] and even axes. This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of [[Wikipedia:Wakizashi|wakizashi]], while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary.\n\nThis transformational quality also appears to extend to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles that includes giant [[Wikipedia:Circular saw|buzzsaws]] and shafts of chakra, the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 460, pages 11-13</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, the group of samurai who initially demonstrate this technique are never depicted employing shape transformation unlike in the manga, instead retaining just a simple aura of chakra that surrounds their blades for the entirety of their short confrontation with [[Sasuke Uchiha]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 202</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Flying Swallow]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Sable de Samurai]]\n[[fr:Technique de Sabre du Samouraï]]\n[[pl:Technika Szabli Samuraja]]\n[[ru:Техника Сабли Самурая]]"
