It was invented by [[Kakashi Hatake]] as a replacement for the [[Lightning Cutter]], which he could no longer safely use after the loss of his [[Sharingan]]. In ''[[Kakashi Hiden]]'', Kakashi typically uses Purple Electricity to strike targets from a distance, though he does sometimes use it through direct contact, as when he places his hand on spilled alcohol in order to transmit Purple Electricity throughout the surrounding area. He can modulate the intensity of the Purple Electricity, creating a blast strong enough to remove a target's [[blue fire powder|explosive]] vest but without setting off the explosive or otherwise affecting the target. Conversely, he is later shown using all his [[chakra]] to perform a Purple Electricity powerful enough to induce the rain clouds he's falling through to start producing rain.\n\nPurple Electricity has sometimes been shown used in ways reminiscent of the Lightning Cutter and Chidori, with the user gathering [[lightning]] into their hand and quickly striking targets with it,<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 21, pages 13-14</ref><ref>''Boruto'' episode 13 </ref> or using it similarly to the [[Chidori Current]], where the user releases bolts of purple lightning from all around their body in a omni-directional attack.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 37</ref><ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 4, page 13</ref><ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 23, page 15</ref> After mastering [[Uchiha Style Kenjutsu]] under Sasuke’s tutelage, Boruto learns to channel his own Purple Electricity through his blade, similar to [[Chidori Katana]].<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 6</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The term \"shiden\" is part of the idiom {{translation|\"shiden'issen\"|紫電一閃|lit meaning=violet electricity flash}}, which refers to a sword flash or a quick brandishing of a sword akin to lightning.\n* Before his manga debut at using it, Boruto was listed as being able to use this jutsu himself.<ref name=\"BV1\" /> In the anime, Boruto originally used this technique through the [[Shinobi Gauntlet]]. Boruto evidently could not use it himself at the time, as it was what tipped off [[Naruto Uzumaki]] that Boruto must be using the tool.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 61</ref>\n* While he has yet to use the technique in the anime, Mitsuki is seen using it in the second version of the opening, [[BAKU (song)|BAKU]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hell Stab]]\n* ''[[Pink Lightning]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Raiton - Flash Violet]]\n[[id:Raiton: Shiden]]\n[[pl:Raiton: Shiden]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Raio: Eletricidade Roxa]]\n[[ru:Стихия Молнии: Пурпурное Электричество]]"
