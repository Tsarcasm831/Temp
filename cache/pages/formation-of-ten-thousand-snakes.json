With such overwhelming numbers, a true \"wall of snakes\" is formed, making defence and evasion meaningless. The enemy can do nothing but become buried by the snakes. The snakes can bite the enemy with their [[poison]] fangs and open their mouths to extend [[Sword of Kusanagi (Orochimaru)|Kusanagi]]-like blades, making them even more deadly. Furthermore, when the inexhaustibly crawling snakes gather together, they become a defensive wall, and can block any kind of attack. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* ''Mandara'' is the Japanese pronunciation of the word ''[[Wikipedia:Mandala|mandala]]'', a concentric diagram with great spiritual and ritual significance in both Buddhism and Hinduism. It's written as 曼陀羅 in kanji. The first kanji is pronounced the same as the kanji for {{translation|''ten thousand''|万}} and actually overlaps somewhat in meaning. The second kanji bears a strong resemblance to the kanji for {{translation|''snake''|蛇}}. The last kanji is the same in both words and means ''silk'', or ''gauze''. However, it is only used for its sound.\n* This technique is part of other technique that appears in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5]]'', called \"Uwabami\", but the snakes that Orochimaru spits don't spits swords, but instead attack the opponent like a tsunami.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Ola de Diez Mil Serpientes]]\n[[fr:Formation de Combat - Myriades de Serpents]]\n[[pl:Mandara no Jin]]\n[[pt-br:Formação das Dez Mil Serpentes]]"
