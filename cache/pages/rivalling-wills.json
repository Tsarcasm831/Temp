Once the opponent is pinned down, Hashirama uses [[Wood Release Secret Technique: Nativity of a World of Trees]] to restrain the opponent while Madara uses [[Fire Release: Great Fire Annihilation]] to burn the forest. Hashirama then taunts Madara if that's all he's got by creating a deeper forest and Madara responds by creating an even bigger and stronger fire, resulting in a massive explosion.\n\n[[pl:Iji no Hariai]]"
