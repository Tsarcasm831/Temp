Gaara can control the sand lumps with his [[chakra]], allowing him to ensure they strike their target and even guide them towards the target's blind-spots. Because this control allows Gaara to strike the target from multiple directions at once, the target's attention will be focused upwards as they attempt to avoid it. As such, the technique is an effective distraction, allowing Gaara to use another source of sand to attack the target from underfoot.<ref name=\"d2\"/> This ground-level sand, in addition to being useful for [[Sand Waterfall Funeral|followup attack]]s, can also be used to [[Sand Binding Coffin|immobilise]] the target, preventing them from escaping the Sand Drizzle.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 215</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Iron Sand Drizzle]]\n* [[Water Release: Drizzle]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Llovizna de Arena]]\n[[fr:Bruine de Sable]]\n[[pl:Suna Shigure]]\n[[pt-br:Garoa de Areia]]"
