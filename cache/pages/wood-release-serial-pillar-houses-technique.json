Because of the sheer volume of structures created with this technique, it appears to exhaust him rather quickly.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Yamato and this technique were crucial in the rebuilding of [[Konohagakure]] after its destruction by [[Pain]]'s [[Shinra Tensei]].\n* It should be noted that in the anime, these constructs emerged fully painted and with glass windows.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Mokuton - Palais aux Mille Piliers]]\n[[pl:Mokuton: Renchūka no Jutsu]]"
