[[Kazuma]] described it as the ultimate [[Earth]] element [[Reincarnation Ninjutsu|resurrection technique]].\n\n== Overview ==\nBy utilising soil in the local ground, the user can revive the fallen in one of two ways.\n\nThe first version allows the user to seemingly continuously resurrect a large number of slain people as zombies, but with none of their rationality, physical prowess, or [[Jutsu|techniques]] at their disposal. They are fairly easy to destroy. If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.\n\nThe second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware. Unlike the [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|Impure World Reincarnation technique]], the [[soul]] is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed. This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e. [[Lightning Release|electricity]]). At any time, by performing a Snake [[hand seal]] and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Técnica de Resurrección: Levantamiento de los Muertos]]\n[[fr:Technique Doton de Résurrection - Sol de Cadavres]]\n[[pl:Doton Soseijutsu: Shishi Dojō]]"
