The technique is performed with four separate scrolls and a sample of blood similar to a [[Summoning Technique]]. Shizune mentioned that good [[chakra]] control and concentration are needed to perform the sealing technique. To use this technique, a scroll is needed to seal the numerous amounts of chakra. This technique was supposed to seal the [[Three-Tails]] in its own dimension, permanently. While sealing the users are vulnerable to enemy attacks. This technique has three stages: \n# \"Search\": the barrier is erected to locate the target. \n# \"Bind\": the barrier is then stretched out above the target.\n# \"Lock\": the barrier is lowered and the sealing begins.\n\n[[de:Kekkai: Shihou Fuujin]]\n[[fr:Barrière de Scellement Quadrilatérale]]\n[[pl:Kekkai Shihō Fūjin]]\n[[pt-br:Formação da Barreira de Selamento de Quatro Pontas]]"
