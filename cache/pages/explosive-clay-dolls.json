Deidara then uses them to fight his opponent in close combat. Their body structure allows them to extend their body parts and not be sliced by normal means, however, a [[lightning]]-infused [[Chidori|chop]] or [[Sword of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana|sword]] will suffice. If a clay figure loses a body part, Deidara can simply attach a clay cord to it and form another clay figure. As the clay figures are made from explosive clay, Deidara can also detonate them at any moment while they are fighting the opponent.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While unnamed in the anime, it was named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]''.\n* Until sufficiently cut down, these clay minions did not adhere to Deidara's usual aesthetic designs, appearing misshapen and clumsy.\n\n[[es:Muñecos de Arcilla]]\n[[pl:Ningyō Kibaku Nendo]]"
