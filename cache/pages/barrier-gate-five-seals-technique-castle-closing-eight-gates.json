When activated, it causes four giant gates to emerge north, east, south, and west of the targeted area. Afterwards, the gates form a barrier around the area. This barrier has a very high durability, and anything that makes contact with it is immediately engulfed in flames. The only way to pass through the barrier unharmed is with a special seal. Upon the death of the caster, the barrier will be dispelled.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The gates are based on the [[Wikipedia:Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean mythology. The northern gate is based on the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise]]|玄武|Genbu}}, the eastern gate is based on the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon]]|青龍|Seiryū}}, the southern gate is based on the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Vermilion Bird|Vermilion Bird]]|朱雀|Suzaku}}, and the western gate is based on the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]]|白虎|Byakko}}.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Four Violet Flames Formation]]\n* [[Four Red Yang Formation]]\n* [[Six Red Yang Formation]]\n* [[Uchiha Flame Formation]]\n\n[[es:Barrera de Cinco Sellos: Cierre de las Ocho Puertas del Castillo]]\n[[pl:Kekkaimon Gofūjutsu: Hachimon Heijō]]"
