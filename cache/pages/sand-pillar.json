Gaara manipulates the sand to suspend and manoeuvres himself in mid-air at high speeds. The sand maintains contact with the ground, thus creating a pillar-like formation.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto Retsuden: Naruto Uzumaki and the Spiral Destiny]]'', it is revealed that Gaara is capable of building a sand pillar up to 200 kilometres high. But since he combined this pillar along with the stone pillar of [[Kakashi Hatake]] and [[Kurotsuchi]], as well as the wooden pillar of [[Yamato]], it is unknown whether Gaara could reach this height on his own.\n\n[[es:Pilar de Arena]]\n[[fr:Piller de sable]]\n[[pt-br:Pilar de Areia]]\n[[ru:Песчаная Колонна]]"
