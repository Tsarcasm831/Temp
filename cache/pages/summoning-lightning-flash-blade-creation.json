The ninja tools can be summoned in an instant just by touching the sealing \"marks\" which can be drawn anywhere. The greatest advantage of this technique is that the time between taking out a ninja tool, taking the right stance and actually throwing it is greatly reduced. Also when a weapon such as a [[fūma shuriken]] is summoned, the time needed to throw it can be further shortened by having prepared the weapon in its fully extended form beforehand.\n\nThe ninja tools are thrown with the speed of a flash of lightning, ruining the opponent's outset of the battle, and snatching away the initiative. Furthermore, because the summoned ninja tools can remain hidden until right before they are used, if this technique is mastered, there are an exceptional number of possible tactics. A large number of ninja tools can be stored within the sealing marks, which can make the efficiency of this technique last longer.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Sasuke's bracelets are beige in the manga and purple in the anime.<ref>Volume 43 cover</ref>\n* In the manga, Sasuke later applied this seal as a tattoo on his wrist.<ref>''Sasuke Retsuden'', chapter 8.2, page 5</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Unsealing Technique: Shuriken]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Invocation - Création d'Armes en un Éclair]]\n[[pl:Kuchiyose: Raikō Kenka]]\n[[pt-br:Invocação: Transformação da Lâmina Relâmpago]]"
