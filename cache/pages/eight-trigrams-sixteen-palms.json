It is essentially a halved version of the already halved [[Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms]]. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through sixteen [[chakra points]] of an opponent's [[chakra pathway system]]. This eliminates their ability to use [[chakra]] for quite some time and renders them unconscious. It also appears to cause internal damage, as Mukai's target was spitting up blood.\n\nOnce someone is within range of his field of divination, Mukai assumes his Gentle Fist stance and begins to deliver his attack:\n* First, two consecutive strikes to make two.\n* Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.\n* Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.\n* Fourth, eight consecutive strikes making a total of sixteen.\n\n[[pt-br:Oito Trigramas: Dezesseis Palmas]]"
