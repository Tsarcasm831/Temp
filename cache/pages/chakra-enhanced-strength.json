This is done by storing [[chakra]] into one's hands or feet, and releasing it onto the target with pinpoint timing. With this strength, the user can decimate the ground or even kill opponents with a single strike.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 246, page 12</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 263, page 13</ref> The training for this application is quite arduous, as Tsunade repeatedly came at [[Sakura Haruno]] with full force to help her learn.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 270, pages 9-10</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It should be noted that [[Tsunade]] already possesses incredible raw strength, capable of crushing stones in a single hand with nothing but pure muscle power.\n* In ''[[Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light]]'', Itachi can enhance his strikes in a manner similar to this technique.\n* In ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'', [[Naruto Uzumaki]] was able to use a similar technique by transferring [[Kurama]]'s [[chakra]] to his arm.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Butterfly Bullet Bombing]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Fuerza Amplificada con Chakra]]\n[[pt-br:Punho Adamantino]]\n[[id:Kongōken]]\n[[ru:Усиленная Чакрой Мощь]]\n[[pl:Siła Wzmocniona Czakrą]]\n[[fr:Force Améliorée au Chakra]]"
