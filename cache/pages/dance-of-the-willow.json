There is no set way in which the bones are used for this \"dance\": ''[[Tō no Sho]]'' likens his movements to the branches of a [[wikipedia:willow|willow]], swaying in the wind. In keeping with this, Kimimaro's movements while using this technique are mostly evasive and his attacks are primarily parries and counters. Kimimaro usually only uses bones sprouted from the palms of his hands, but if these aren't enough he can produce additional bones from his knees, elbows, and shoulders so that he can attack multiple targets at once.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The [[wikipedia:weeping willow|weeping willow]] is identifiable by its grey trunk and long, thin branches that bend down and move with the wind.<ref>''[[Tō no Sho]]'', page 207</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Danza de los Sauces]]\n[[fr:Danse du Saule]]\n[[pl:Yanagi no Mai]]\n[[pt-br:Dança do Salgueiro]]"
