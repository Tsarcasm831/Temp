This humanoid creature with a full body and an oni-like face is usually created with a [[Wood Release: Wood Dragon Technique|wooden dragon]] wrapped around its torso, and is generally used in battle as an avatar. The wooden dragon can be multiplied and be used to attack its enemies directly as well. This creature is stated to be as powerful as the [[Nine-Tails]],<ref name=\"d4\"/> and could catch an uncompressed, uncharged, standard [[Tailed Beast Ball]] fired by the latter. If the user doesn't have enough time to manifest the entire body, they can manifest a limb or two first to buy enough time for the full body to form.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 620, page 17</ref> It could even clash against the likes of [[Madara Uchiha]]'s Complete Body — [[Susanoo]], which was stated by Madara himself to have destructive powers rivalling even the [[tailed beasts]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 641, page 5</ref> \n\nIn the anime, it is capable of spawning multiple Wood Dragon heads, each capable of self-destructing.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 367</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThis technique seems to be based upon {{translation|[[wikipedia:Tentōki and Ryūtōki|Ryūtōki]]|竜燈鬼|Dragon-Lamp Demon}}, a creature from Japanese folklores, who is typically depicted as a small [[Wikipedia:Oni|oni]] with a dragon coiled around its torso. Together with {{translation|Tentōki|天燈鬼|Heavenly-Lamp Demon}}, the pair symbolise the power of the [[Wikipedia:Four Heavenly Kings|Shitennō]] to repel and defeat evil.\n\nThe Buddhist monk [[Wikipedia:Myōe|Kōben]] sculpted notable wooden statues of both Tentōki and Ryūtōki, which are each considered a National Treasure of Japan.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When Hashirama used the [[Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands]] technique, this creature was depicted sitting atop the statue's head.\n* While never seen using it in the series, [[Tobi (Zetsu)|Tobi]] is listed as a user of this technique in [[Jin no Sho]].<ref name=\"d4\"></ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Mokuton - Colosse Sylvestre]]\n[[pl:Mokuton: Mokujin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Madeira: Técnica do Humano de Madeira]]"
