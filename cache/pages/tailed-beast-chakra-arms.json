The jinchūriki will use the raw [[chakra]] of their [[Tailed Beast]] to form arms, which they can freely manipulate to attack their foes, able to strike an opponent faster than even a [[Sharingan]] user can react to.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 231, page 6</ref> The chakra arms' hands are clawed while the rest of the arm seems to lack any kind of joint, thus allowing them to have flexible movements that will generally be impossible for normal arms. The user can create any number of arms that they desire and they can also serve other purposes such as grappling hooks, to either grab onto objects or enemies from great distances, for offensive means, as merely touching one of these can cause fatal burns, due to the Nine-Tails' seething hatred within its chakra (though this is not always the case). Due to having chakra attached to his body, the chakra arms can grow in size and from the [[Version 2|fourth tail]] up, Naruto, the arms, or any part of his body can divide into two or more fully operational appendages.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 294, pages 5-10</ref> [[Killer B]] has also been shown to use this technique though instead of arms, he can form horns which he uses for his [[Lightning Release: Lariat]] technique.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 413, pages 10-11</ref>\n\nIn his [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode]], Naruto can use the chakra arms to a greater extent, as he can use and release chakra arms from anywhere on his body on a small or large scale. These arms even have the power to crush stone without Naruto putting much thought into it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 515, page 9</ref> In the anime Naruto was able to crush a sword with a chakra arm just by tightening his grip.<ref name=\"ship317\">''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 317</ref> After some practice, he mastered the chakra arms, able to manipulate various stones and geometric shapes without crushing them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 516, page 14</ref> Now he is able to use them in an attempt to create a new technique: the [[Tailed Beast Rasengan]] since he was advised by the [[Eight-Tails]] against the use of [[shadow clones]] in this form.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 519, page 15</ref> Naruto's mastery of the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms is so great that he is able to [[Spiralling Strife Spheres|create several at once]] to launch attacks at several enemies, use them to [[Spiralling Absorption Sphere|pull enemies into]] the attack, and even [[Mini-Rasenshuriken|create tiny ones around his finger]]. The arms also grant him a greater level of dexterity and manoeuvrability out of what would normally be a helpless situation,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 549, pages 10-11</ref> such as guiding his Rasenshuriken during his fight against the [[Third Raikage]]. Not only that, Naruto can control each individual shroud he [[Chakra Transfer Technique|gives out]] to protect his allies.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Gaara]] never used a tailed beast chakra shroud form like Naruto and Killer B. He instead uses his sand control to shape existing sand into arms. He has shown [[Monstrous Sand Arm|similar techniques]] when he does slip into his [[Jinchūriki Forms#Partial Transformation|Shukaku forms]].\n* In ''[[Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze]]'', [[Magire]] and [[Kido Tsumiki]] created a [[Tailed Beast Drug]] that allowed them to use the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Card Battle]]'', [[Naruto]]'s powerful blows in [[Jinchūriki Forms|Jinchūriki Form]] are known as {{translation|\"Simple Strike\"|無造作な一撃|Muzōsana Ichigeki}}.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hands of Bonds]]\n* [[Hands of Flame]]\n* [[Monstrous Sand Arm]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Armas de Chakra de Bestia con Cola]]\n[[fr:Bras de Chakra de Bijû]]\n[[pl:Chakura no Te]]\n[[pt-br:Mão de Chakra]]\n[[ru:Руки Чакры Хвостатого Зверя]]"
