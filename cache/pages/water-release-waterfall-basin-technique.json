This is a very convenient technique as it can be used for training or relaxation. On the other hand, because it changes the environment on a large scale, it also has the effect of hiding one's location from the enemy by confusing them. The width of the water source, waterfall, and basin can be expanded as long as the user continues to send chakra in. \n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden]]'', Konohamaru tries to copy this technique by summoning an octopus.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Suiton - Bassin de la Cascade]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Takitsubo no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Água: Técnica da Bacia da Cachoeira]]"
