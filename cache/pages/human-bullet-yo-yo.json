At the same time, Ino [[Sensing Technique|detects]] any enemies in the immediate vicinity and [[Sensing Transmission|transmits]] this information directly to Shikamaru. As Chōji begins to attack with the [[Human Bullet Tank]] technique, Ino continues to track their opponents so that Shikamaru can perfectly direct Chōji's movement by [[Shadow Clutch Technique|manipulating the shadow]]. How this formation functions and its overall appearance is akin to a person using a [[wikipedia:yo-yo|yo-yo]], albeit in a destructive manner.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the telepathic dimension of Ino and Shikamaru, this technique when shown as a silhouette looks similar to [[Wikipedia:Ultra Series|Ultraman]], a superhero who controls a huge yo-yo which is connected with his middle finger and uses it to smash his enemies.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Yo-Yo de Bola Humana]]\n[[fr:Yo-Yo de Chair]]\n[[pl:Nikudan Yōyō]]\n[[pt-br:Ioiô da Bala Humana]]"
