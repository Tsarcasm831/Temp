The linear motion and force applied to draw the sword from the scabbard results in slashes that are faster and stronger than ones executed with the sword already drawn.\n\nThe speed at which these techniques can be executed — the initial strike in particular — is such, that when performed by a skilled user, it can prevent enemy shinobi from forming [[hand seals]] (and thus [[ninjutsu]]), by exploiting the small opening that these movements create. This makes them highly effective against most shinobi and potentially, those of even [[Hanzō]]'s calibre, if performed by someone such as [[Mifune]] who has mastered the style.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 531, page 13</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Battōjutsu]]\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Izuna Uchiha]]'s sword skills were shown similar to this style.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iaido}}\n\n[[es:Iaidō]]\n[[fr:Iaidô]]\n[[pl:Iaidō]]\n[[pt-br:Iaidō]]\n[[ru:Иайдо]]"
