It is possible to seal [[ninjutsu]] into a scroll, as demonstrated by [[Kisame Hoshigaki]], who placed sharks into his [[Water Prison Technique]] that he sealed into a scroll, which would activate and imprison anyone that tried to read the scroll upon opening it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 508, page 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Treasured Tools Sealed.png|thumb|left|Tenten's unique usage of the technique.]]\nTo save chakra, instead of sealing a nature element into a scroll that was created through chakra, one could just use pre-existing nature elements, like water from an ocean, and seal it within the scroll. Though a scroll is the most common use of sealing something, as demonstrated by [[Ajisai]] in the anime, this technique can be used to seal things into a small sheet of paper too.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique is fundamental to the creation of ammunition for the [[Shinobi Gauntlet]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Technique d'Incorporation]]\n[[pl:Fūnyū no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Anexamento]]"
