When Naruto was in [[Version 1|control]] of Kurama's power, he too could produce these shockwaves by roaring.<ref name=\"Ch229\">''Naruto'' chapter 229, page 5</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 292, pages 9-11, 18</ref> [[Jinchūriki Forms#Initial Jinchūriki Form|Initially]], these shockwaves could deflect projectiles, fracture infrastructure and destroy some ninjutsu,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 28, page 14</ref><ref name=\"Ch229\"/> but their raw force in Version 2 is such that they can rebound even [[Pain]]'s [[Shinra Tensei]] back upon himself.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 438, pages 5-6</ref>\n\nWhen used by Kurama itself, it's powerful enough to completely disperse powerful attacks like the [[Sage Art: Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan]], and even knock back fully transformed tailed beasts.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 497, page 6</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 571, pages 8-9</ref>\n\nWhen used by the [[Ten-Tails]] with a single shockwave, it can destroy mountains while tearing up the landscape for miles in its initial form,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 610, page 1</ref> as well as use it to initiate its [[Tenpenchii]] in its mature form after it recovers from its emaciated state.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 628, page 15</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While it was unnamed in the manga and anime, it was named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]''.\n* There have been times while using Kurama's chakra where Naruto has produced shockwaves or even explosions through punches or waves of his arms.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 292, page 16</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 294, page 4</ref><ref>[[A Plea from a Friend]]</ref> However, since these instances have never been indicated to involve firing chakra, it's unclear if they were produced with this technique or through sheer speed.\n\n== See Also == \n* [[Dramingo]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Grand Rugissement]]\n[[pl:Daihokō]]\n[[pt-br:Grande Rugido]]"
