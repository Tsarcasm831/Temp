These cannons can \"liquidise\" his [[chakra]] and then shape it into weapons such as whips or [[sword]]s. He can shoot liquid balls that can bind the opponent or stick them together with their ally, which prevents them from forming hand seals. He can shoot it at such high pressure that it can even shatter rocks. The substance is so durable that even when consecutively struck with a solid gold statue, it didn't break. It lasts two to three days before it crumbles. Jako claims that it was because he was such a foul person that his chakra had turned into what it was.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Jako's chakra liquid appears to be derived from [[Wikipedia:Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'s spider webbing, even mimicking the hand gesture Spider-Man uses when Jako activates the technique.\n* In ''[[Naruto Retsuden: Naruto Uzumaki and the Spiral Destiny]]'', [[Chihare Amano]] experiments with liquid chakra to create a device that allows the use of multipotent chakra. She reveals that the chakra is liquefied using a special jutsu.\n\n[[es:Chakra Líquido]]\n[[pl:Ciekła Czakra]]\n[[ru:Жидкая Чакра]]"
