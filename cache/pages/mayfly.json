Then, using the underground network of organic matter, consisting of things like plant roots and water veins, he can travel everywhere with high speed. Using this technique he can conceal himself in such things as trees and even sand. Once merged, his presence is completely concealed, making it impossible to detect him, even for [[sensor type]] ninja like [[Karin]].<ref name=\"db\" /> This makes this technique perfect for close-ranged spying.\n\nIf a White Zetsu does not wish to leave its location, it can connect itself to the nearby network of plant roots in order to send messages to other Zetsu.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 536</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Efímera]]\n[[fr:Déplacement Éphémère]]\n[[pl:Kagerō (jutsu)]]\n[[pt-br:Efemeróptero]]"
