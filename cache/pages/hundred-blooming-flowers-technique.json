With the target hindered, she can freely move through the flower petals and attack the target without being seen. \n\n== Drawbacks ==\nThe downside to this illusion is that it only hides Karenbana visually. Meaning the target is still able to interact with the outside world, as seen when [[Naruto]] released a widespread shock wave to knock her back, and when [[Sakura]] was able to pinpoint her location after hearing her step on broken glass.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Though unnamed in the movie, this technique was named in the ''[[Naruto Collectible Card Game]]''.\n\n[[es:Genjutsu: Dispersión de Pétalos]]\n[[pl:Technika Stu Rozkwitających Kwiatów]]"
