Afterwards, the puppet and victim become connected, allowing any damage done to the puppet to be shared with the connected individual. Even if the victim dies, the connection isn't severed, leaving their corpse to eternally be a puppet.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to [[Kakashi Hatake]] and [[Might Guy]], this technique was developed by Ryūki based on a common type of jutsu, and that he imitated several Jashin ceremonies based on documents he came across. Kakashi also questioned the validity of such Jashin documents.\n\n[[fr:Arcanes Maudites - Hémo-Manipulation]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Maldição: Controle de Corpos pelo Sangue]]\n[[ru:Техника Проклятия: Контроль Тела Управлением Крови]]"
