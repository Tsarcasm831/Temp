The clones kick or punch the target into the air, each yelling \"U-ZU-MA-KI\" (\"NA-RU-TO\" in some English translations) as they do so as the real Naruto himself leaps off a clone to chase after the target.\n\nWhile both the target and Naruto himself are airborne, Naruto finishes with a {{translation|rotating/spinning heel dropper|回転かかと落とし|kaiten kakato otoshi}}, sending them back towards the ground as he yells out the rest of the technique's name.\n\nNaruto modelled this manoeuvre after [[Sasuke Uchiha]]'s [[Lion Combo]], increasing its lethality by combining the Lion Combo's taijutsu with the shadow clones' ninjutsu.<ref name=\"d1\" />\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n* The [[Naruto: Clash of Ninja (series)|''Clash of Ninja'']] series allows Kakashi to directly copy this technique via his Sharingan.\n** Also in the ''Clash of Ninja'' series, the GameCube titles incorrectly have both Naruto and Kakashi use the Tiger Hand Seal for summoning the shadow clones when using the Naruto Uzumaki Combo. This was eventually corrected in the Wii-sub series.\n* Later versions of this technique involve multiple shadow clones attacking in a continuous sequence instead of a surrounding-array, which still leads into the upwards kick to prime the heel drop finisher.\n* In both ''Battle Stadium D.O.N.'' and for his Part 1 self in the ''Ultimate Ninja Storm'' series, Naruto only uses one clone to start the combination technique instead of at least 4.\n* In the crossover comic series ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Naruto]]'', Naruto performs a [[Cooperation Ninjutsu|variation]] of the technique with [[w:c:turtlepedia:Michelangelo (TMNT x Naruto)|Michelangelo]] called '''Uzu-Mikey-Angelo Barrage''', without the use of shadow clones.<ref>''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Naruto'' Issue 3, page 22</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Uzumaki Naruto Furie]]\n[[pl:Uzumaki Naruto Rendan]]\n[[ru:Комбо Наруто Узумаки]]\n[[pt-br:Rajada de Naruto Uzumaki]]"
