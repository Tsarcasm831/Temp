This momentary handicap can be utilised either by the user or their allies to attack the opposition whilst their vision is still impaired.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* While the kanji in the term {{Translation|\"rinpun\"|鱗粉}} literally mean \"scale powder\", the term refers specifically to insect [[Wikipedia:Scale (Lepidopteran anatomy)|scales]] (such as the \"dust\" on moth wings). According to old wives' tales, that dust causes blindness.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'' and ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]'', the powder appears to be orange as well as [[Scale Powder Blasting|combustible]], while in the anime, it is bright white. They are also an ability of Chōmei's, while in the manga, that is unconfirmed.\n* This technique can be effectively countered if the target's eyes are protected for the duration of the technique, or otherwise possess [[Sensor|sensory abilities]] to compensate for the loss of sight.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 564, page 8</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es: Jutsu Secreto: Ocultación en el Polvo de Escamas]]\n[[fr:Technique Secrète - Brouillard Étincelant]]\n[[pl:Hiden: Rinpungakure no Jutsu]]"
