This technique allows them to warp several seconds into the past. While normally defensive, essentially allowing the user to seemingly teleport away from danger, repeated usage of this technique grants a pseudo-form of clairvoyance. With the acquired knowledge of how the near-future will happen, a perfect counter-strategy can be formed from being able to accurately tell how the enemy will act. However, due to the effects of the technique, the user experiences more time than those around them, putting the user at risk of prolonged exposure to hazardous conditions."
