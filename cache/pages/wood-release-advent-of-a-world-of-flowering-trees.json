During the forest's formation, the user can have the branch restrain any target(s) that tries to attack the user before the formation of the forest is complete. The pollen produced by these flowers is then released into the atmosphere and when inhaled, renders any afflicted target unconscious. The user can also control where the pollen spreads so it does not affect them nor their comrades. The pollen is also capable of penetrating [[Susanoo]]'s defences.\n\nWith enough willpower, it is possible to regain consciousness, however, in order to counter the technique fully, either the trees themselves must be destroyed completely or the target must continue to remain elevated above the dispersed pollen.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Madera: Advenimiento de un Mundo de Árboles de Flores]]\n[[fr:Mokuton - Émergence Arborée]]\n[[pl:Mokuton: Kajukai Kōrin]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Madeira: Advento do Mundo de Árvores Floridas]]"
