The barrier is not visible to the standard eye; when viewed with certain [[dōjutsu]], it can be seen that there is a design of several circles which have the kanji for {{translation|''boundary''|界}}, and {{translation|''barrier''|結界|kekkai}} inscribed in them. When linked with a [[Sensing Water Sphere]], all [[Sensing Barrier Pass Technique|unauthorised passage]] in and out of the barrier can be detected and pinpointed.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This barrier surrounds [[Konohagakure]] and is maintained by the village's [[Konoha Barrier Team|barrier team]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 419, pages 2-4</ref>\n* In the anime, the [[Third Hokage]] promised not to change the formula of the barrier so [[Itachi Uchiha]] may sneak back in from time to time to watch over [[Sasuke Uchiha|his younger brother]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 359</ref>\n* Despite a civilian's death, Konohagakure does not change the barrier to take note of that, as [[Koji Kashin]], clone of the long deceased [[Jiraiya]], was able to pass the barrier without triggering an alarm.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Barrier: Canopy Method Formation]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Barrera de Límites]]\n[[fr:Barrière Sensorielle]]\n[[pl:Kanchi Kekkai]]\n[[pt-br:Barreira Sensorial]]"
