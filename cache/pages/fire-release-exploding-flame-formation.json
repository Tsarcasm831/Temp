When the target steps in place, the user slams their palm on the ground and causes the explosive tags to stream towards the target, wrapping around their body from the feet upwards and sticking to them. Once in place around the target's legs, the tags detonate simultaneously, causing a large explosion capable of blasting through solid rock and engulfing the target in flames. On one occasion, despite Hanzō commending [[Nagato]] for having avoided this technique, the latter still suffered permanent damage to his legs that severely restricted his mobility, attesting to its destructive power.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 447, pages 3-6</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, Hanzō used this technique in his battle against the [[Sannin]]. In this instance, he used a sequence of four [[hand seals]] rather than simply slamming his palm on the ground.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 128</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Paper Person of God Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Etiquetas Explosivas de Hanzō]]\n[[fr:Katon - Formation de Flamme Explosive]]\n[[pl:Katon: Kibaku Enjin]]"
