When eaten, they will transform into a demonic-like being, and will have access to all of the target's abilities. The user also uses this technique to absorb chakra and transform it into chakra pills to grant them immense power and temporary immortality, although one has to keep taking the pills to retain enhanced abilities and immortality.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The pills Momoshiki creates from Chakra Fruit are specifically referred to as the {{translation|Cinnabar Elixir|仙丹|Sentan}} in the film novelisation and ''Road to Boruto'' expansion for ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]'', referring to the [[wikipedia:Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]] from Chinese folklore. In Chinese folklore, the [[wikipedia:Moon rabbit|moon rabbit]] is depicted using a mortar and pestle to create the elixir of immortality, continuing the trend of associating the Ōtsutsuki clan with the moon rabbit.\n\n[[Clan::Ōtsutsuki Clan| ]]\n\n[[fr:Création de Chakra Comestible]]\n[[pl:Stworzenie Jadalnej Czakry]]\n[[pt-br:Criação de Chakra Comestível]]"
