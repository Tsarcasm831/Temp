The moment the brush is removed from the scroll, the images leap from the paper, grow to life-size, and act according to the user's will. Because they are made of ink, a single blow is usually enough to dispel them. For discreet communiques while undercover, Sai is able to turn the words he writes into small animals, allowing them to travel unnoticed to the intended target, after which the ink animal requires a scroll to revert back into written information.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 457, page 4</ref> In addition to the animals it is normally used to create, Sai can produce [[explosive tag]]s.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 520, page 19</ref> In the anime, for the drawings to retain stability upon emerging, the user's emotional state must have a true passion for them. Otherwise, the drawings will immediately splatter.<ref name=\"B33\">''Boruto'' episode 33</ref> \n{{-}}\n\n== List of Drawings ==\n=== Sai's ===\n<gallery hideaddbutton=\"true\" columns=\"3\" position=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nTomoe Lion.png|{{translation|Tomoe Lion|巴獅子|Tomoe Shishi}}<ref name=\"UN5\">''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5''</ref> - for attacking from a distance. They are usually created in small groups as {{translation|Wild Lions|乱獅子|Ranjishi}}<ref name=\"UNS2\" /> to attack foes directly.\nInk Eagle.png|{{translation|Hawk|鷹|Taka}}<ref name=\"TCG\">''Naruto Collectible Card Game''</ref> - can be ridden for reconnaissance or high-speed travel. Smaller variants can be used to carry [[explosive tag]]s or be used to deliver messages.\nInk Mouse.png|{{translation|Rat|鼠|Nezumi}}<ref name=\"TCG\" /> - can swarm across an area to search for a target much faster than the user would be able to on their own. Being so small, the rats are inconspicuous, also making them suitable for covert message delivery.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Snakes.png|{{translation|Snake|蛇|Hebi}}<ref name=\"UNS2\">''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2''</ref> - can be used as ropes to restrain someone. With the ability to soundlessly enter through even the smallest crevice, they can also be used for assassination purposes.\nSealing Technique Tiger Vision Staring Bullet.png|[[Sealing Technique: Tiger Vision Staring Bullet|Tiger]] - as with lions, this tiger be used to swarm a target and attack. Also used for [[Sealing Technique: Tiger Vision Staring Bullet|sealing]] his enemy.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing - Dragon.png|{{translation|Dragon|龍|Ryū}}<ref name=\"UN5\" />, used in the anime's [[Power (Arc)|Power arc]].\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Bat.png|Bat,<ref name=\"TCG\" /> seen in the anime - can morph into a makeshift umbrella, or attach themselves to the enemy's face and blind them.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Fish.png|Fish, seen in the anime - Useful in delivering messages in water.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Leech.png|Leech, seen in the anime - Larger and heavier leeches can also be drawn.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Crab.png|Crab imitation of the [[Gatekeeper]], seen in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]''.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Animals.png|Cat, rabbit, and squirrel, seen in the [[Sai's Day Off|anime]].\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Owl.png|Owl, seen in ''[[Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds]]''.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Inojin's ===\n<gallery hideaddbutton=\"true\" columns=\"3\" position=\"center\" widths=\"200\">\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Dogs.png|Dog.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Hawk.png|Hawk, used for transportation and picking up objects.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Sparrow.png|Sparrow, used for distractions and delivering messages.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Lizard.png|Lizard, used for intimidation.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Anomalocaris.png|Anomalocaris, used to detonate.\nSuper Beast Imitating Drawing Shoebill.png|Shoebill, used for transportation.\n</gallery>\n\n== Influences ==\nThis technique is in reference to the [[Wikipedia:Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga|Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga]] (lit. ''Animal-person Charicatures''), or Chōjū-giga for short, a set of four picture scrolls belonging to the [[wikipedia:Kōzan-ji|Kōzan-ji Temple]] in Kyōto, Japan and sometimes credited as the first manga. The scrolls depict various anthropomorphic animals dancing and playing about in a lively ceremony, which seems to be the basis for Sai being able to animate his own drawings for various purposes.\n\n[[File:Sai Training Inojin.png|thumb|Two different aesthetic designs used for the technique.]]\n[[Inojin Yamanaka]]'s usage of the technique differs from his father's in terms of the aesthetic design. Unlike Sai's round drawings, Inojin's have sharp, straight lines. Inojin remarked that his father's sense of style appears to be \"old-fashioned\" compared to his own.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 700+1, page 10</ref> Appropriately, his design is named {{translation|Super Beast Imitating Drawing: Modern Era|超獣偽画・現代|Chōjū Giga: Gendai}}.<ref name=\"Inojin Volume 2\">''Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Volume 2's Inojin's Profile''</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to both users of this technique, it does not work as well in rain.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 573, page 12</ref> Despite this, in the anime, Sai was shown using this technique to create a fish and an umbrella.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 81</ref>\n* In ''[[Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles]]'', [[Rock Lee]] was able to paint mice with the head of [[Might Guy]]. [[Tenten]] painted a large, \"cute\", humanoid bunny and panda bear. Sai still had to perform the technique to animate their drawings.\n* In the anime, Inojin uses coloured ink for his Super Beast Imitating Drawing creatures in addition to the black ink Sai uses.\n* In the anime, Sai noted that [[Boruto Uzumaki]]'s passion and love of his drawings could possibly make him well-suited for this technique.<ref name=\"B33\"/>\n* In the anime, because the drawings are animated with his chakra and move around, Inojin can use them to extend the range of his [[Sensing Technique]].<ref>''Boruto'' episode 177</ref>\n* In ''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 9, [[Nine-Tails (chapter)|Nine-Tails]], Inojin's use of this technique is called '''Super Beast Cartoon Drawing''' (超獣戯画, ''Chōjū Giga''). Whether this is a mistake or a new jutsu is unknown.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[C1]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Toile aux Monstres Fantomatiques]]\n[[pl:Chōjū Giga]]\n[[pt-br:Desenho de Imitação da Super Besta]]"
