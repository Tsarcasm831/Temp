Minato first throws a [[Flying Thunder God Kunai]], be it a direct attack at his opponent; once the kunai has reached close proximity to the target, or even past them, he would then teleport to the said kunai, immediately attacking his target from their blind-spot. The speed at which this technique is executed along with the unpredicted secondary attack is such that even an individual who possesses the [[Sharingan]] is unable to react in time.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Tobirama]] executed a similar manoeuvre with a regular marked kunai.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 661, page 8</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Dieu du Tonnerre Volant - Seconde Étape]]\n[[pl:Hiraishin — Ni no Dan]]\n[[pt-br:Raijin Voador: Nível 2]]"
