The user [[Shadow of the Dancing Leaf|follow]]s the opponent along their upward trajectory, taking tight hold of them so that they can't move or escape; [[Rock Lee]] wraps opponents with the bandages he wears to help in this regard. Once they've reached the peak of the initial kick's arc, the user begins a spinning motion and propels them headfirst towards the ground.<ref name=\"d1\"/> The user releases the opponent right before impact and retreats to safety, leaving the opponent to collide with the ground alone. Because the Front Lotus requires at least one of the [[Eight Gates]] be opened, users are likely to be fatigued afterwards and thus vulnerable to attack. For this reason, [[Might Guy]] mandates that Lee only use the Front Lotus to protect something or someone important.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 52</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, Lee was eventually able to perform this technique without any strain on his body.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 193</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Peregrine Falcon Drop]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Loto Primario]]\n[[fr:Fleur de Lotus Recto]]\n[[pl:Omote Renge]]\n[[pt-br:Lótus Frontal]]"
