According to [[Obito]], this binding power is far greater than that of [[Nagato]]'s Outer Path.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 569, page 10</ref> The chains possess a [[cursed seal]] that suppresses the power of [[tailed beasts]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 598, page 10</ref> and also cause a great deal of pain to their victims.<ref name=\"ch567\">''Naruto'' chapter 567, pages 7-8</ref>\n\nObito was able to generate these chains through the use of [[black receiver]]s. He implanted a single receiver into each of his [[Six Paths of Pain#Obito's Paths|Six Paths of Pain]], which were made into temporary [[jinchūriki]]. By manifesting chains from the jinchūriki's receivers and connecting them to his hand, he was able to bind and [[Sharingan|suppress]] the tailed beasts inside them in the event that they resisted his control.<ref name=\"ch567\"/> When [[Naruto Uzumaki]] was trapped inside the [[Four-Tails]]' mouth, Obito attempted to capture him by dragging the beast inside his own body using these chains.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 569, pages 2-4</ref> The beasts were also bound by chains within their consciousness; when the receivers were removed from their jinchūriki's bodies, these chains were replaced by a single larger chain connecting directly to the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]], permitting Obito to quickly reseal them into the statue.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 570, pages 1-6</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonic Statue Chains.png|thumb|left|The Demonic Statue emitting chains.]]\nThe Demonic Statue itself is able to emit chakra chains from its mouth. When [[Madara]] retrieved his [[Rinnegan]] and took control of the statue, he used it to produce chains with tips shaped like a dragon's head.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 659, pages 15-17</ref> These chains were able to quickly restrain and seal all nine tailed beasts by wrapping around their necks like collars and dragging them into the statue. The chains are also capable of extracting tailed beasts from their jinchūriki, as well as preventing them from cancelling their [[Tailed Beast Mode]]. In the event that they are severed, these chains can easily be reconnected.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 660, pages 1, 12-13</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 661, pages 1-4</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Adamantine Sealing Chains]]\n* ''[[Beast Sealing Technique]]''\n* [[Dharma Power Sealing Technique: Sen no Rikyū]]\n* [[Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals]]\n* [[Tight Binding Golden Chain Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Rinnegan no Gedou Mazou no Kusari]]\n[[es:Cadenas de Chakra (Camino Externo)]]\n[[fr:Chaînes de la Statue du Grand Démon]]\n[[pl:Mazō no Kusari]]\n[[pt-br:Correntes da Estátua Demoníaca]]"
