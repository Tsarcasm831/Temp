First, a halo of bright energy spreads around the user's hands as this technique is activated, then it encircles the user's hand and from that, the beams are shot out towards the enemy.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 527, page 14</ref> The user is able to alter the beam's direction after being shot, making it possible to strike multiple enemies with pinpoint accuracy, even bypassing hostages held in close proximity.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 527, page 15</ref> The user can also increase the number of beams to a great amount to pin down an enemy.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 528, page 12</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* As with many of the techniques of [[Kumogakure]] ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as 'Reiza Sakaso'.\n* In the anime, the beams disconnect from their source in Darui's hands.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 203</ref> This has never happened in the manga and was corrected in a later episode.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 269</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Ranton - Laser Circus]]\n[[pl:Ranton: Reizā Sākasu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Tempestade: Laser Circus]]"
