By swinging his arms - which are more powerful than normal because of his transformation - the shuriken are launched rapidly, with additional volleys being possible with each additional swing. The Sand Shuriken, made to be stronger than steel, easily cut through whatever they come into contact with. This technique is a useful way to fend off approaching attackers, as well as a good way to stop opponents from fleeing.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Paper Shuriken]]\n* [[Water Release: Water Shuriken]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Shuriken de Arena]]\n[[fr:Shuriken de Sable]]\n[[pl:Suna Shuriken]]"
