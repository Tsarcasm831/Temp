The rate at which the chakra is gathered and released is so fast that escaping the technique is impossible through normal means.\n\n== Influence ==\nIn Buddhism and other Asian religions, the [[wikipedia:Padma (attribute)|lotus flower]] symbolises detachment, because although a lotus is living in water, its leafs do not get wet. In Jūgo's case, his second personality is detached from his normal self. The looks of this technique and the second part of its name make an allusion to [[wikipedia:Acorn barnacle|acorn barnacles]], called {{translation|\"fujitsubo\"|フジツボ}} in Japanese. The kanji 不自 literally mean \"negative self\", once again referring to Jūgo's second personality.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Asura Attack]]\n* [[Concussive Chakra Cannon]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Cañones de Chakra Explosivo]]\n[[fr:Multiples Canons Lotus Connectés Non-Autonomes]]\n[[pt-br:Múltiplos Canhões Alheios do Lótus]]"
