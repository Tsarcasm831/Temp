This enables them to detect and track down targets through their [[chakra]] signatures. The range of this technique varies between sensors.\n\n== Unique Sensory Techniques ==\n* [[Spider Web Area]] — Exclusive to [[Kidōmaru]]. With this technique, he is able to send chakra through webs to detect the approach of any enemy, that touches the threads. The web is so sensitive, that not even the slightest disturbance of the air goes unnoticed.\n* [[Mind's Eye of the Kagura]] — Exclusive to [[Karin]]. With this technique, she is capable of finding, sensing and tracking any individual over vast range by focusing and opening her mind's eye.\n* [[Rain Tiger at Will Technique]] — Exclusive to [[Nagato]]. Using this, he is capable of creating falling raindrops, which are closely linked to his senses. When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected.\n* ''[[Sensing Hexagram Seal]]'' — A hexagram seal that allows the [[Shishio|user]], by transmitting waves, to sense targets in a large radius, akin to a radar.\n* [[Sensing Water Sphere]] — A sphere made out of [[water]] that lets the user monitor the surrounding area. Despite the usefulness, the sphere itself does not provide a complete form of detection, unless it is complemented with a [[Sensing Barrier|barrier]].\n* ''[[Negative Emotions Sensing]]'' — Exclusive to [[Kurama]] [[Mito Uzumaki|and]] [[Naruto Uzumaki|its]] [[Minato Namikaze|jinchūriki]]. Using this technique, the user is capable of detecting negative emotions, such as hatred, of any individual around them.\n* [[Concealed Sand Picture Cat]] — Exclusive to [[Gaara]]. With this technique, he is able to spread [[sand|specialised sand]] across a wide terrain and detect anything that comes into contact with it, even if the target is invisible.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Throughout the series, various characters have commented on the ''feel'' of chakra and similar comments regarding the ability to sense high, foul or potent levels of chakra a little, leading to the possibility that chakra sensing is merely a more refined version of this by either teaching or being simply born more \"sensitive\".<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 24, pages 4-5</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 502, page 3</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 554, page 1</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 616, page 4</ref>\n* In the anime, if a sensor struggles sensing beyond a limited range, they can expand it with a medium that employs their chakra to move around. Sensing was also methodically compared to the Yamanaka Clan's [[Mind Body Switch Technique]].<ref>''Boruto'' episode 177</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Detección de Chakra]]\t\n[[fr:Technique de Perception]]\n[[id:Kanchi no Jutsu]]\n[[pl:Kanchi no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Sensorial]]"
