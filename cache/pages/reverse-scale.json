Unlike Code and Kawaki, Delta can modify her legs to enable her jet propulsion, granting her flight.\n\nShould an affected limb be lost, the user is not incapable of shaping their flesh and can simply extend it around where the limb used to be, such as in Kawaki's case from when he briefly used a [[Absorbing Hand|prosthetic]] before gaining a new arm.\n\n{{-}}\n\n== Modified Appendages ==\n<gallery widths=\"170\" columns=\"3\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\">\nKawaki's Arm.png|Kawaki's right arm.\nCrushing Burial.png|Delta's legs.\nCode's Modifications.png|Code's hands.\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker]]'', the names of the various techniques and weapons Kawaki creates from his flesh using the Scientific Ninja Tools are given a motif revolving around [[wikipedia:Scale (anatomy)|scales]]:\n** The technique itself referring to the mythological inverted scale on a dragon's body that will incite its fury if touched. It can also be translated as '''Imperial Wrath''', referring to the act of provoking the wrath of a king or emperor.\n** The knuckle knives he wielded against [[Garō]] are called '''Armour Scales''', referring to the scaled plates of an animal with a shell.\n** The small pieces of shrapnel he uses as throwing knives are called '''Scale Fragments''', referring to individual scales of a scaled animal.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Sage Transformation]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[pl:Gekirin]]"
