Jiga claims to be able to do this because of the great amount of iron he ingests. He can activate or deactivate his own body's magnetism, ensuring that he is not affected by his technique. The potential risk of his technique is exploited when [[Hinata Hyūga]] introduces an interfering electric current into his [[chakra]], causing he himself to become a powerful magnet. In this state, he attracts a large quantity of iron sand to himself, and is forced into a vortex of sand and killed.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Though similar to [[Magnet Release]], Jiga actually gained this ability through ingesting iron when he was younger and as such is not a [[kekkei genkai]] but an unorthodox bodily adaptation.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Arte Ninja Magnético]]\n[[pl:Jishaku Ninpō]]\n[[pt-br:Arte Ninja Magnética]]"
