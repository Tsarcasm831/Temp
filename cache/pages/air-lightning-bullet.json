The user then jumps above them and punches them back down. Then, the user binds the opponent with large [[shuriken]] from above, then lands on them with a powerful stomp.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This move becomes Iruka and Mizuki's new neutral special in both ''Gekitō Ninja Taisen 3'' and ''4'', and as a result, Kakashi can only copy this attack with his Sharingan instead of [[Air Lightning Strike]].\n* While Mizuki's version functions the same, it instead has a different name known as the Kūsendan (空旋弾, lit. Air Whirling Bullet) instead."
