Though his is incomplete, Boruto is able to throw it.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 169</ref>\n\n== Tailed Beast Influence ==\nIn the ''[[Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise|Sasuke Shinden]]'' novel, Naruto uses the power of the [[Nine-Tails]] to form a Wind Release: Rasengan that he's able to throw; he also doesn't need any shadow clones to create it. When it hits its target, it creates a shockwave of wind away from Naruto. In the anime, Naruto instead uses \"[[Rasengan: Flash]]\".\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, [[Asura Ōtsutsuki]] developed [[Amenomihashira]], a precursor to this technique.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[de:Fuuton: Rasengan]]\n[[es:Elemento Viento: Rasengan]]\n[[fr:Fûton - Orbe Tourbillonnant]]\n[[id:Elemen Angin: Rasengan]]\n[[pl:Fūton: Rasengan]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Vento: Rasengan]]\n[[ru:Стихия Ветра: Расенган]]\n[[tr:Rüzgar Tipi: Rasengan]]"
