Like the shield, Gaara crushes the hardest materials from the ground using [[sand]], this time in the form of a halberd, in the shape of the Shukaku's hand. Just like the shield which has yet to find anything that could break its defence, the halberd has yet to find a defence that it can't break through.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Crystal Release: Crystal Lance]]''\n* [[Dance of the Clematis: Flower]]\n\n[[pt-br:Supremo Ataque Absoluto: Lança de Shukaku]]\n[[pl:Saikō Zettai Kōgeki: Shukaku no Hoko]]"
