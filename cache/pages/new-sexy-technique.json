After seeing it, Jiraiya encourages Naruto to take a form that is wearing a [[wikipedia:Thong (clothing)|thong]], which he believes will give him [[Icha Icha|inspiration]]. Confusing a thong for a [[wikipedia:mawashi|mawashi]], Naruto transforms into a [[wikipedia:sumo wrestler|sumo wrestler]]. Jiraiya is first startled, then disturbed, then angry to see it, having expected another scantily-clad woman. He complains bitterly until Naruto, irritated, uses the form to knock Jiraiya out.\n\nNaruto brags about this \"new\" Sexy Technique when he returns to [[Konohagakure]], claiming it's far superior to the original. He is attacked by [[Sakura Haruno]] before he has a chance to demonstrate it.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 245, pages 16-17</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique debuts in \"[[The New Erotic Ninjutsu Completed!!]]\", an [[omake]] included with ''[[Kai no Sho]]''.
