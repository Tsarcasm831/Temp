By doing so the object can be shaped, animated, and controlled remotely. On command, the object's size can also be manipulated — from nano-sized to gigantic heights.\n\nOnce the user infuses their chakra into an object, it can become a source of origin for a technique. Deidara stole this technique in his quest to find the ultimate art and used it in conjunction with his [[Explosion Release]] [[kekkei genkai]] to infuse explosive chakra into clay, creating his signature [[Explosive Clay]]. Sekiei, a [[fabrication]], was given both the [[nature transformation]] and this technique to utilise it in the same way.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is likely that the mouths on Deidara's palms and chest are the result of using this technique, though Sekiei didn't seem to possess them.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Kinjutsu de Iwagakure]]\n[[fr:Kinjutsu d'Iwa]]\n[[pl:Iwagakure Kinjutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Kinjutsu de Iwagakure]]"
