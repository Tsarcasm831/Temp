The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\n== Overview ==\nThis technique was originally created by [[Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki]] in order to \"connect\" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of [[ninshū]], but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\n== Variations ==\n* Certain people, such as [[Minato Namikaze]] and [[Naruto Uzumaki]] could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 617, page 5</ref> In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 616</ref> Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\n* [[Katsuyu]] and [[Tsunade|its]] [[Sakura|summoners]] have a unique bond between them through [[Strength of a Hundred Seal]] and they can use [[Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing]]. Tsunade used this technique during [[Pain]]'s invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers. [[Sakura]] used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 634, pages 7-8</ref>\n* [[Tsunade]] used again this technique during the five [[Kage]]'s fight against [[Madara Uchiha]] to give [[Ōnoki]] some of her chakra so that he could use a massive [[Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique]] to defeat Madara's [[wood clone]]s.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 588, pages 13-15</ref> Sakura later used this technique to improve [[Obito]]'s [[Kamui]].\n* [[Zetsu]]'s [[Spore Technique]] creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 466, pages 9-11</ref>\n* [[Dan Katō]] was able to use this technique as a [[Spirit Transformation Technique|spirit]] in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and [[Strength of a Hundred Seal]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 591, page 16</ref> Obito did something similar to give his chakra and [[dōjutsu]] [[Susanoo|powers]] to [[Kakashi]] after his body had been turned to ashes.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 688, page 2</ref>\n* [[Jūgo]] was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's [[Jūgo's Clan's Kekkei Genkai|unique ability]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 413, page 15</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 618, page 13</ref>\n* [[Tailed beasts]] are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as [[Kurama]] has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 572, page 10</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 609, pages 13-14</ref>\n* [[Samehada]] was able to absorb and transfer chakra to its wielder. It was also able to transfer chakra from Kisame back to Killer B.<ref>\"Naruto\" chapter 471, page 14</ref><ref>\"Naruto\" chapter 472, page 16</ref>\n* [[Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki]] was the first user of this technique to [[Ninshū|connect all humans]] living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 665, page 6</ref> Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra. He gave the power to them to defeat Madara. While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 671, pages 14-16</ref> \n* In the anime, if the [[Aburame]] member has proper control, the [[kikaichū]] are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 304</ref>\n* In the anime, the [[Magaki Group]] uses this technique in a different way. First [[Nangō]] sends his chakra to [[Benten]] and [[Chūshin]], and then both of them send it along with its own to [[Akaboshi]], greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 144</ref> He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Transferencia de Chakra]]\n[[fr:Transfert de Chakra]]\n[[pl:Technika Transferu Czakry]]\n[[pt-br:Transferência de Chakra]]\n[[ru:Техника Передачи Чакры]]"
