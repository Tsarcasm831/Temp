If the targets try to get close to the user, they will sink faster. The user can also form tendrils of the sludge to hold down the victims' limbs or defend themselves.\n\nThe downside to the technique is that the user will sink first and once the user dies, the technique will end. The deeper the user sinks, the more injury and pain they will incur. This makes it less likely to kill other targets, making this technique more suitable for stalling than actual combat. However, the user can cancel the technique as long as they're alive.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Earth Release: Antlion Technique]]\n* [[Earth Release: Swamp of the Underworld]]\n* [[Nose Water Tree]]\n* [[Shadow Gathering Technique]]\n\n[[fr:Ninpô de la Brume - Annihilation Infernale]]\n[[pl:Kasumi Ninpō: Kinjutsu: Jigoku Messatsu]]"
