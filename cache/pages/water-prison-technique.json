[[Neji Hyūga]] was able to free himself by simultaneously [[Gentle Fist Art One Blow Body|releasing]] [[chakra]] from all of his [[tenketsu]], destroying the prison.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 258, page 12</ref> In ''[[Akatsuki Hiden]]'', [[Kisame Hoshigaki]] escaped by [[Water Release: Exploding Water Colliding Wave|increasing the volume of water]] within the prison beyond what it could contain, causing it to burst.\n\nIn order to maintain the prison, users must stay in contact with the sphere, typically by keeping an arm submerged within it. For this reason, [[water clone]]s can be used in combination with water prisons, either by having the water clone attack other targets while the user maintains the prison,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 13, page 10</ref> or by having the clones themselves form the prisons, leaving the user free to act. In cases where a water clone forms the water prison, the water of the clone's body can be used as a source for the prison.<ref name=\"c257\"/> In the anime, this contact is shown to not be necessary, allowing users to trap targets from a distance,<ref>''Boruto'' episode 28</ref> and can draw in other people to trap upon contact with it.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 234</ref>\n\nThe water prison's usefulness has caused it to be adapted for other purposes. It can be stored in scrolls, trapping anyone who tries to read their contents without permission.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 508, pages 15-16</ref> Alternatively, users can confine themselves within a water prison, thus preventing opponents from reaching them.<ref name=\"c508\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, [[Umibōzu]]'s entire body is composed of water, which allows it to drown its opponents inside it, thus leading [[Amachi]] to refer to it as a {{translation|\"Moving Water Prison Technique\"|動く水牢の術|Ugoku Suirō no Jutsu}}.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 172</ref>\n* The hands spread in front, palms out seal used for this is visually similar if not the same as the {{translation|Zai|在}} of the real Kuji-in also known as the \"seal of the ring of the sun\" which is shown as hands spread out in front with palms facing out, thumbs and index fingers touching.\n* In the anime, this technique is used by soldiers of the [[Funato Clan]].<ref>''Boruto'' episode 245</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Funato clan| ]]\n[[fr:Prison Aqueuse]]\n[[pl:Suirō no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica da Prisão de Água]]\n[[ru:Техника Водяной Тюрьмы]]"
