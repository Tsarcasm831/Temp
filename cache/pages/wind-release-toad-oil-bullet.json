It was ad-libbed from Naruto's and Gamatatsu's [[Wind Release: Toad Gun]] technique, using toad oil instead of water. Naruto moulds his wind-natured chakra, while Gamatatsu moulds his own chakra into the oil in his mouth. On command Gamatatsu will [[Wikipedia:Fluid pressure|expel the oil]] from his mouth, and combine it with the wind chakra that Naruto channels into Gamatatsu's body, creating a powerful and fast stream of toad oil, which spreads to cover a much larger area but maintaining a powerful striking force due to the wind-natured chakra.\n\nThis technique sets up for [[Gamakichi]]'s [[Fire Release: Flame Bullet]] technique, which combine to produce the [[Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet]] technique.\n\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Vento: Projétil do Óleo de Sapo]]\n[[pl:Uwolnienie Wiatru: Pocisk Ropuszego Oleju]]"
