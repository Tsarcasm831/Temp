This training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet, and using it to climb a tree without using one's hands. If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off. If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to fracture around the point of contact and the user will fall. The concept of this exercise is similar to magnetics. This is evidenced when [[Sasuke]] was able to attract a [[kunai]] [[Naruto]] threw his direction to his feet and then throw it at an enemy by kicking the kunai while releasing his chakra's hold on the kunai.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'', [[Sunagakure]] has a similar training revolving around rock climbing.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Cliff Climbing Practice]]\n* [[Water Surface Walking Practice]]\n\n[[Category:Naruto Terms]]\n\n[[fr:Escalade des Arbres]]\n[[id:Latihan Memanjat Pohon]]\n[[pl:Ki Nobori no Shugyō]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Correr em Obstáculos]]"
