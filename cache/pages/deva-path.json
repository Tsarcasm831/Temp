If used at high intensities, not only will it result in a long downtime, but it could potentially shorten the user's lifespan. The Deva Path also grants another ability: [[Chibaku Tensei]] which allows the user to create a huge makeshift terrestrial body from all the surrounding matter that is attracted to a black sphere released by this technique. \n\nThough he used the powers of the Deva Path prior to being crippled, Nagato spent the remainder of his life channelling the power through the corpse of his deceased friend [[Yahiko]], using him as the face of his Pain alias. In the anime, through Pain, Nagato demonstrated the ability to levitate in midair prior to levelling [[Konoha]] and during his battle against [[Naruto]] in his [[Version 2|six-tailed]] state.\n\n== Influences ==\nIn Buddhism, the [[wikipedia:Deva (Buddhism)|Deva realm]] is the realm of bliss. The Deva realm is sometimes also referred to as the \"god's realm\" because, compared to humans, its inhabitants are so powerful that they could be compared to deities. However, beings born into the Deva realm are still subject to reincarnation. Devas suffer from pride and the knowledge that their long lives and powers will not prevent their eventual rebirth.\n\n[[es:Camino Deva]]\n[[fr:Tendô]]\n[[id:Jalan Deva]]\n[[pl:Tendō]]\n[[pt-br:Caminho Deva]]"
