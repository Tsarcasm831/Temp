In this way, the user can quickly extract and utilise groundwater or water from vegetation, should no other source be avaliable.\n\nIt can be used to block incoming [[Human Bullet Tank|attacks]] and explosions, [[Water Prison Technique|trap]] or drown opponents, and shape the water into various shapes. Uniquely, the user can employ a strategy to suspense countless droplets in the air in order to redirect projectiles, act as a shield, or quickly take hold of an opponent. \n\nHaving the ability to manipulate the water from long distances allows the user, in conjunction with the [[Summoning Technique]], to make use of water-based summonings to fight in areas that it normally wouldn't be able to. \n\nShould there be no avaliable water source, this technique cannot be used.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* 水天彷彿 is a Japanese idiom referring to a view of the horizon where the earth and the sky cannot be easily distinguished.\n* [[Ruiga]] uses his [[tonfa]] as dowsing rods to ensure he stays in areas with groundwater for this technique. As a result, Ruiga tends to avoid rocky areas where water source is scarce.<ref>Episode 189</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<References/>\n\n[[pl:Suiton: Suiten Hōfutsu]]"
