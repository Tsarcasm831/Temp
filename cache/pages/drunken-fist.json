Because they are intoxicated, users move irregularly and erratically: they attack with no warning and defend with unconventional motions. Users have no conscious awareness of what actions they'll take, which also means opponents can't predict what they'll do. In [[Rock Lee]]'s case, he also becomes extremely belligerent while drunk, thereby adding to his opponent's confusion because of how polite he usually is.<ref name=\"d2\"/> According to [[Might Guy]], the Drunken Fist cannot be learned, taught, nor refined through training and practice.{{Citation needed}}\n\nLee is a natural prodigy of the Drunken Fist.<ref name=\"d2\"/> After drinking only a small amount of alcohol, his cheeks become red and he goes into a drunken rage, picking fights with friends and foes alike.<ref name=\"c210\">''Naruto'' chapter 210</ref> Since he's already very gifted with taijutsu, Lee is extremely destructive in his drunken state;<ref name=\"d2\"/> during his first drunk experience, he destroyed the restaurant where he was dining and even Guy struggled to subdue him.<ref name=\"c210\"/> Because of how easily Lee becomes drunk, he also sobers just as easily: when [[Kimimaro]] only scratches his face,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 211</ref> Lee returns to normal shortly afterwards. Lee seems to have no memory of his actions while drunk, or at least he can't understand his hangover.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 212</ref>\n\nIn the anime, Lee developed a variant called [[Seasickness Fist]], where he makes use of nausea caused by [[Wikipedia:Seasickness|seasickness]] to overcome the fact he can't drink alcohol.<ref> ''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 228</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Wikipedia:Drunken boxing|Drunken boxing]] is a [[Wikipedia:Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] where the practitioner imitates the movements of a drunk person.\n* In English translations of the series, the [[Wikipedia:Sake|sake]] Lee drinks is referred to as either a \"potion\" or \"elixir\" to avoid references to alcohol.\n** Despite this, elixir is typically made of 40-60% alcohol.\n* Drunken Fist Lee is playable in some of the [[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja (series)|''Naruto: Ultimate Ninja'' video games]] as a transformation character. The transformation only lasts for a set amount of time.\n* In a censored English version, Lee's cheeks are not red. However in the uncensored English they remain red.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Suiken]]\n[[es:Puño Borracho]]\n[[fr:Technique de l'Homme Ivre]]\n[[pl:Suiken]]\n[[pt-br:Punho Embriagado]]"
