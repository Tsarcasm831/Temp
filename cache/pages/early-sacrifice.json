Once landing, still holding onto the opponent's shoulder, Itachi throws them over himself onto the ground.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the anime, the technique's performance is expanded, including a swinging around of the target to cause them disorientation before the throw is done.\n* This move was only named in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2]]''.\n* This technique's name is also an abbreviated form of {{translation|\"mozu no hayanie\"|百舌の早贄}}, which refers to the prey of the [[wikipedia:Bull-headed Shrike|bull-headed shrike]] when the bird impales it, usually with sharp twigs or thorns. The bird does this so the prey can be ripped in more conveniently-sized bits for consumption.\n\n[[es:Primer Sacrificio]]\n[[fr:Sacrifice Précoce]]\n[[pl:Hayanie]]"
