To an observer, it appears as if the user has teleported. It is accomplished by using chakra to temporarily vitalise the body and move at extreme speeds. The amount of chakra required depends on the overall distance and elevation between the user and the intended destination.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nA puff of smoke is occasionally used to disguise the user's movements. Other elements or substances can be used instead to distract the opponent: [[Gaara]] uses sand for the {{translation|'''Sand Body Flicker'''|砂瞬身|Suna-Shunshin}};<ref name=\"d1\"/> in ''[[Shikamaru Hiden]]'', [[Sai]] uses ink for the {{translation|'''[[Ink Mist Technique|Ink Mist Body Flicker]]'''|墨霞瞬身|Sumigasumi-Shunshin}}. Villages can even have their own variants, as in the {{translation|'''Mist Body Flicker'''|霧瞬身|Kiri-Shunshin}}, {{translation|'''Water Body Flicker'''|水瞬身|Mizu-Shunshin}}, and {{translation|'''Leaf Body Flicker'''|木ノ葉瞬身|Konoha-Shunshin|lit meaning=Tree Leaf Body Flicker}}.<ref name=\"d1\"/>\n\nAlthough the Body Flicker Technique is common to almost all shinobi, some are particularly renowned for their usage of it. [[Shisui Uchiha]] was feared as {{translation|\"Shisui of the Body Flicker\"|瞬身のシスイ|Shunshin no Shisui}}; whenever he employed this technique, Shisui would fade away from sight, leaving no trace of his presence. In the anime, Shisui was also able to generate [[Afterimage Clone|clones]] through the technique. When the [[Third Raikage]] utilised the technique, it looked like a bolt of lightning appeared and disappeared from the area. The [[Fourth Raikage]] often combined the Body Flicker Technique with the [[Lightning Release Chakra Mode]] which allowed him to dodge [[Amaterasu]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Certain [[space–time ninjutsu]] are sometimes confused with the Body Flicker Technique, as it creates the illusion of the user instantly moving from one place to another. However, whereas space–time ninjutsu actually transport the user through space, this technique is merely high-speed movement.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 395, page 9</ref> Despite this, the [[Flying Thunder God Technique]] is regularly mistaken for \"Body Flicker Technique\" by various individuals, including the technique's [[Tobirama Senju|creator]], due to targets not seen to be tagged for the \"Flying Thunder God Technique\".<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 240, page 10</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 637, page 14</ref>\n** Further confusion exists in some translations of the series. In Viz's English translations, the Body Flicker Technique is called \"Teleportation\", whereas space–time ninjutsu are generally referred to as \"Transportation Techniques\".\n* The Body Flicker Technique is similar to [[Swift Release]], a [[kekkei genkai]] that allows the user to [[Swift Release: Shadowless Flight|move at high speeds]].\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Swift Release: Shadowless Flight]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[de:Shunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[es:Jutsu de Cuerpo Parpadeante]]\n[[fr:Déplacement Instantané]]\n[[it:Tecnica del Trasferimento Istantaneo]]\n[[pl:Shunshin no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica do Deslocamento Instantâneo]]\n[[ro:Tehnica de Teleportare]]\n[[ru:Техника Телесного Мерцания]]\n[[uk:Хисло тілоряхтіння]]\n[[vi:Shunshin no Jutsu]]"
