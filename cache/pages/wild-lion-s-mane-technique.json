There is also chakra flowing through the lengthened hair, making its hardness comparable to that of steel wire. By thickly bundling the hair, its strength is further increased, also increasing its destructive power. Its name may come from the fact that, as seen just before striking [[Pain]], it takes the shape of what resembles a lion's mouth.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Hair Binding Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Crinière Hirsute du Lion]]\n[[pl:Ranjishigami no Jutsu]]"
