The size and form of these torii, which boast an absolute binding force, matches the target in which it is used against. Not only is the target arrested and unable to move even a finger, but the torii also blocks their will of opposing the technique and is thus rendered completely docile.<ref name=\"d4\" />\n\nHashirama was even able to use this technique to immobilise the [[Ten-Tails]] and [[Obito Uchiha|its jinchūriki]]. Hashirama can pile the torii atop one another in an attempt to increase their ability to immobilise the target.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 638, pages 10-11</ref> When Obito was able to control the power of the Ten-Tails, he was able to break through these.\n\n== Variants ==\nThe exact number and size of the torii involved in this technique can vary dependent upon what the user specifies:\n\n* {{translation|'''Seal Ten'''|封十|Fūtō|viz=Ten Seals}}: Creates ten torii that can be used to pin several individual targets simultaneously.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 631, pages 9-11</ref>\n* {{translation|'''Seal Head'''|封頭|Fūtō|viz=Head Seal}}: Creates a single, large torii, intended to pin the target's neck beneath it, so as to immobilise their head.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 632, page 10</ref> The target is imbued with [[natural energy]] to stop it from resisting.<ref name=\"d4\" />\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The 頭 kanji, used in the \"Seal Head\" variant of the technique, is also used as a counter for large animals.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution]]'', the colour of torii are grey instead of red, as portrayed in the manga and anime. This was corrected in ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Torii Seal]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Senpô - Porte du Dieu de Lumière]]\n[[pl:Senpō: Myōjinmon]]\n[[pt-br:Arte Eremita: Portão Divino]]"
