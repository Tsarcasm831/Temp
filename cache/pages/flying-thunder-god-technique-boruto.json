Though it produces nearly identical results it is technically different enough to be considered an entirely separate technique, and has more limitations.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 16, pages 1-2</ref>\n\nBoruto's version harnesses his teleportation ability to translocate to metal objects he previously marked with his chakra, allowing him to freely and instantly move wherever he chooses. Metal objects, including weapons, accessories, and utensils, were chosen as the medium due to their chakra conductivity. The translocation is easier and more accurate when used on objects within visual range, however for objects that are far away the process is more difficult, and if they have similar shapes he may be unable to discern which is which. For this reason he prepared a variety of metal objects with distinct shapes to act as unique symbols that he could visualize in order to accurately translocate to his intended coordinates even over great distances. Some of the objects he has marked include Sasuke's sword, his shuriken, his metal jewelry and pins, and several metal symbols carried by Koji's scout toads.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 16, pages 3-6</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to [[Koji Kashin]], it originally would have taken Boruto about six years to develop and hone the technique through trial and error. However, after Koji used his [[Ten Directions]] [[shinjutsu]] to learn the basic theory behind it, he was able to help accelerate Boruto's training by imparting wisdom gleaned from the future to him. To which, Boruto was able to master it within only about two years of intense training.<ref>''Boruto: Two Blue Vortex'' chapter 16, page 7</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Dieu du Tonnerre Volant (Boruto)]]\n[[pl:Hiraishin no Jutsu (Boruto)]]"
