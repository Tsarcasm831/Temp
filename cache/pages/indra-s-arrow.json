It proved to be extremely powerful, able to match [[Naruto Uzumaki]]'s [[Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken]] despite Lightning Release's inferiority to Wind Release.\n\n== Influence ==\nThis technique draws influence from Hinduism, where [[wikipedia:Indra|Indra]], the god of thunder and wars, used a rainbow as a bow to fire arrows made of lightning; the thunderbolt is also said to be given the name Vajra, which is synonymous with diamond or adamantine in a Japanese context.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique derives its name from [[Indra Ōtsutsuki]], the ancestor of the [[Uchiha clan]] and, in the manga, the first user of Susanoo.\n* In ''[[Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections]]'', Indra performs a similar variation, creating a spear of electricity.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Susanoo: Blade of Yachihoko]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Flèche d'Indra]]\n[[pl:Indora no Ya]]"
