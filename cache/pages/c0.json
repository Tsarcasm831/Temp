Deidara reveals a mouth on his chest, which is stitched up. After undoing the stitches, Deidara feeds it a large ball of clay. The mouth on his chest has a direct connection to his heart so a large amount of chakra is built up. It then kneads chakra directly from the meridians of the heart and keeps doing it without interruption until the moment of the explosion. His [[Explosion Release|explosive chakra]] then manifests itself in his veins, flowing through his body. These \"veins\" then condense into a sphere that slowly cracks open and detonates, producing a unique explosion that covers a ten kilometre blast radius.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The shape of the explosion bears a resemblance to [[Wikipedia:Tarō Okamoto|Tarō Okamoto's]] [[Wikipedia:Tower of the Sun|Tower of the Sun]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:C0]]\n[[pl:Shī Ō]]\n[[pt-br:C0]]\n[[fr:C0]]"
