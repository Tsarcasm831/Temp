As the user's body is already a hive of sorts for the insects, the user will encase themselves in an actual cocoon to further aid the insects. This is an extremely useful move for [[Aburame clan]] members, since their attacks mainly focus on the usage of insects. However, using this in the midst of a battle can be potentially dangerous as it leaves the user static and vulnerable. As such when this technique is being employed, the user generally finds a safe location or otherwise can be guarded by their teammate.\n\n[[es:Jutsu Secreto: Capullo de Insectos]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Secreta: Casulo de Insetos]]\n[[pl:Hijutsu: Mushimayu]]"
