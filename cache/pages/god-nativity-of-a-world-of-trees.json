By ensnaring all living beings and connecting them to the tree, similar to cocoons, this will keep their now-slumbering bodies alive so long as they remain attached, while sapping their chakra. At the same time, this assimilates every victim to the God Tree, regathering the [[chakra]] into one location, in order to sprout a new [[Chakra Fruit|fruit]]. It is one of the Jutsu with the greatest expansive power, spreading throughout the planet.<section end=summary />\n\n[[File:White Zetsu Creation.png|thumb|left|White Zetsu being created from humans caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.]]\nThe chakra can also be collectively used by the user of this technique, as proven when Madara Uchiha's body began to rapidly absorb the chakra of everyone connected to the tree during his transformation into [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]]. Over the course of years,<ref>''Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise''</ref> humans ensnared by this technique will be drained of their personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into [[White Zetsu Army|White Zetsu]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 679, pages 8-9</ref> Simply cutting the victims loose neither wakes them up, nor frees them from the tree, as other branches will relentlessly form and imprison them once again.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 683, page 10</ref>\n\nOnce the Infinite Tsukuyomi is cancelled, the branches, along with any preexisting White Zetsu, wither away and the entrapped people would be freed, assuming they have not already been converted into White Zetsu.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 699, pages 8-11</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Naissance Divine d'un Monde d'Arbres]]\n[[id:Dewa: Kelahiran Dunia Pohon]]\n[[pt-br:Divino: Nascimento do Mundo de Árvores]]\n[[pl:Shin: Jukai Kōtan]]\n\n[[Category:Kekkei Mōra]]"
