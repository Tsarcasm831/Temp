On releasing the pressure, not only is the user's strength enhanced, but their speed increased as well.<ref name=\"c565\">''Naruto'' chapter 565, pages 14-15</ref>\n\n== Improvement ==\nHan wears special [[steam armour]] covering his entire body. The armour contains a furnace in its back, where steam is produced. The steam can be built up within the armour for a greater release, allowing just a [[Erupting Strong Foot|simple kick]] to violently send an opponent reeling a great distance away.<ref name=\"c565\" />\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In video games, Han has shown that he can use the hot steam emitted from this technique to burn opponents around him.<ref>''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3''</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Ebullición: Fuerza Incomparable]]\n[[fr:Futton - Force Inégalée]]\n[[pl:Futton: Kairiki Musō]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Fervura: Força Inigualável]]\n[[ru:Стихия Кипения: Непревзойдённая Сила]]"
