This makes it impossible for [[sensor type]] [[shinobi]] to track them via chakra. As noted by [[Shikamaru Nara]], this technique is very useful in allowing one to infiltrate an enemy's ranks. However, due to having one's chakra suppressed, they will be unable to use [[jutsu]].\n\nThe [[Ōtsutsuki Clan]] can naturally suppress their chakra signature. A [[Kāma|vessel]] which been has sufficiently changed into an Ōtsutsuki can access this ability on instinct, without being consciously aware of its existence. Unlike regular shinobi, they're still able to use ninjutsu, as Kawaki created and maintained a [[shadow clone]] while suppressing his true body's chakra. However, fellow Ōtsutsuki and vessels can detect the user regardless.\n\n[[Clan::Ōtsutsuki Clan| ]]\n[[it:Tecnica di Soppressione del Chakra]]\n[[fr:Technique de Suppression de Chakra]]\n[[es:Jutsu: Supresión de Chakra]]\n[[pl:Technika Tłumienia Czakry]]\n[[pt-br:Personificação de Chakra]] \n[[ru:Техника Подавления Чакры]]"
