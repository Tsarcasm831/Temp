The user can ride the wave, allowing them to move at high speed, and attack the enemy, now swept off their feet. The amount of water created is proportional to the amount of chakra used; when used with Kisame's enormous chakra, even a dry wasteland can become a small ocean. Afterwards, the excess water can be used for additional Water Release techniques.\n\nIn the anime, Nagato seemingly used this technique, through the [[Yahiko|Deva Path]], covering a small valley by punching the ground causing water to gush out of it instead of spewing it out of his mouth.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 167</ref> Similarly, Isari caused the water waves to form around him after forming the hand seals, instead of expelling it from his mouth.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 234</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Suiton - Vague Explosive]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Bakusui Shōha]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Água: Onda de Choque Explosiva de Água]]"
