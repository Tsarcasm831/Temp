They are also able to manipulate any substance similar to what was absorbed, allowing them to mould it into different forms to create various techniques of their own, while also allowing use of jutsu involved with said substance. Should the need arise, they are able to generate more of the emulated substance from their bodies.\n\n== Usage == \n[[Nagare]], who once took on the properties of a rock, was able to create various imitations of other techniques, like [[Assimilation: Rock Blizzard]] and [[Assimilation: Sand Waterfall Funeral]]. He was also able to turn his skin to rock, either entirely or partly, and could even survive being blown to bits by simply assembling himself.\n\nIn the anime, during the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], the [[White Zetsu Army]] were seen using this ability as well; allowing them to take on the property of the [[Seventh Front|red soil]] around them. This gave them [[White: Assimilation: Poison Mist|poisonous qualities]], that made them into even more formidable soldiers. However, they were also susceptible to adverse effects, gained by the soil's high conductibility to [[lightning]]-type attacks.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 320</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|''Shinra Banshō''|森羅万象|lit meaning=All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things}} is a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All of Nature\" or \"All of Creation\".\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Hiding in Surface Technique]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu de Asimilación Universal]]\n[[fr:Assimilation de l'Univers]]\n[[pl:Shinra Banshō Dōka no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Assimilação da Criação de Todas as Coisas]]"
