Once inside the black space, the target will see grotesque figures, which are thought to be the previous victims of the technique: Kamira claims that these are people who betrayed [[Haido's Knights|Haido's faction]], and became tortured criminals of the {{translation|\"Land of Death\"|死の国|Shi no Kuni}}, being punished with the {{translation|\"power of time\"|時間の力|jikan no chikara}}. These figures then grab the target and pull them into the void where they are at the mercy of a spectral dragon. The horrifying [[Wikipedia:Oni (folklore)|oni]] can even extend from the target's own body to attack them. All of these creatures can transfix the victim with fear and shock while Kamira will appear from above and personally choke and kill the opponent.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is unknown whether or not this technique is a true [[genjutsu]], considering neither [[Haido]] or his [[Haido's Knights|knights]] even knew what [[chakra]] was.\n* This appears to be more of [[Wikipedia:Holography|holographic projection]] than an actual illusion, as when Kamira realises that she was strangling not [[Kankurō]] but [[Karasu]] in disguise, the darkness dispelled, meaning the images were occurring around the puppet instead of a person's mind.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Ilusión de Kamira]]\n[[pl:Iluzja Kamiry]]"
