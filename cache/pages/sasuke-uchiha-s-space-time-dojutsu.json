With it, Sasuke can travel to and from different dimensions that he can locate. \n\nThis technique requires a large amount of chakra, and extended usage leaves Sasuke incapable of using this technique, his [[Mangekyō Sharingan]], and his Rinnegan's full power, for some time.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 700+8, page 17</ref> Sasuke also stated that the number of people who could enter the portal was limited: only the four [[Kage]] and [[Boruto Uzumaki]] joined him on the rescue mission to save [[Naruto]]; however, they were secretly followed through the portal by [[Katasuke|two]] [[Kōsuke (Scientist)|people]].<ref>''Boruto: Naruto the Movie''</ref>\n\n== Trivia==\n* Despite the limited use Sasuke has on this technique, its refinement and might appears to exceed that of [[Kamui]]. Whereas Obito's accessing of another dimension required both his Mangekyō and additional [[Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique|chakra]] from [[Sakura]], which still severely strained his body and sight, Sasuke showed no visible strain besides brief exhaustion from multiple uses.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Ōtsutsuki Teleportation]]''\n* [[Kamui]]\n* ''[[Shin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]''\n* [[Yomotsu Hirasaka]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pt-br:Dōjutsu Espaço-Tempo de Sasuke Uchiha]]\n[[fr:Dôjutsu d'Espace-Temps de Sasuke]]\n[[pl:Czasoprzestrzenne Dōjutsu Sasuke Uchihy]]"
