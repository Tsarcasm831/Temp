It is a [[wind]]-infused version of the [[Water Release: Water Gun]] technique. \n\nTo set up for this technique, Naruto stands behind or atop Gamatatsu, moulding his wind chakra, while Gamatatsu moulds his own chakra and keeps water in his mouth. When ready, Naruto signals Gamatatsu to [[Wikipedia:Fluid pressure|exhale all of the water]] through his mouth, combined with the wind chakra that Naruto channelled into Gamatatsu. \n\nThis technique creates a powerful and fast stream of water, which eventually spreads to cover a much larger area, but maintaining a powerful striking force due to the wind chakra. The attack was strong enough to break through [[Guren]]'s [[Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Labyrinth Technique]], which was suggested to be powerful enough to withstand the [[Rasengan]].\n\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Vento: Revólver de Sapo]]\n[[pl:Fūton: Gama Teppō]]\n[[ru:Стихия Ветра: Жабья Пушка]]"
