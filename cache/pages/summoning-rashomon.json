The gate itself is designed to look frightening, with the gate's doors having a demonic face upon them; this is to intimidate onlookers, potentially warding them off. The gate's doors are tightly shut and solidly built, making it useful as a shield against most forms of physical attack. The stronger the attack, the more damage the attacker will do to themselves when they try and fail to break through the gate.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Sakon and Ukon praise [[Kiba Inuzuka]] and [[Akamaru]] for being able to dent the gate, which they say is [[Orochimaru]]'s strongest defence.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 204, page 11</ref> Despite this, Orochimaru can also use a [[Summoning: Triple Rashōmon|three gate variant]], and beyond that is a [[Summoning: Quintuple Rashōmon|five gate variant]].\n\nIn the anime, this gate possesses offensive capabilities, with launchers installed in the roof-tiles that fire swarms of blades via a chain mechanism. However, launching too many of them near its base will cripple its foundation and the gate will collapse.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 305</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The summoned Rashōmon is based off the [[wikipedia:Rajōmon|main gate]] of old [[Wikipedia:Kyoto|Kyōto]] with the demonic face inspired by the legend that Kyōto's Rashōmon was the home of an oni named [[Wikipedia:Ibaraki-dōji|Ibaraki-dōji]].\n* In some ''Naruto'' video games, this technique is used offensively, the gate being summoned directly beneath the target. Some games depict the gate [[Summoning: Rashōmon Hell|opening and dropping the target in another dimension]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Summoning: Rashomon}}\n[[es:Invocación: Rashōmon]]\n[[fr:Invocation - Rempart]]\n[[pl:Kuchiyose: Rashōmon]]\n[[pt-br:Invocação: Rashōmon]]"
