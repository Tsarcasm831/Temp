As it glides, the [[nature transformation]] abruptly kicks in,<ref>''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'' novel</ref> resulting in the technique disappearing from sight. This adds an element of surprise to the attack, as an opponent may lower their guard, assuming that the technique has dispersed, only to find themselves struck by the invisible attack. The size of Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan has seen a significant increase after the [[Mujina Bandits Arc]], where it was shown to be around the size of a regular Rasengan. With enough chakra added to it, the Rasengan can become [[Parent and Child Rasengan|giant]].\n\nIn the anime, [[Kakashi Hatake]] notes that the invisible nature comes by a loss in offensive power, rendering this technique as incomplete.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 168</ref> [[Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki]] himself later noted that it is too weak to cause a mortal wound, but is quite painful when it strikes a vital point.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 54, page 26</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' novelisation, this technique was stated to use a subconscious application of [[Wind Release]] instead of Lightning Release.\n* In the anime, [[Naruto]] was able to throw a standard Rasengan, similar to the main function of this technique.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 194</ref>\n* In various media, when Boruto uses this technique, he simply calls it \"Rasengan\".\n{{ImgRight|Orange Vanishing Rasengan.png|An orange-coloured Vanishing Rasengan.}}\n* In [[Boruto OVA]], this technique was depicted as orange in colour, similarly to how the original Rasengan is sometimes depicted being yellow in the manga when used by Naruto, and orange on one Jump cover.<ref>''Boruto'' OVA</ref><ref>''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' 2005, Issue #35</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Runt Ball Rasengan]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[id:Rasengan Menghilang]]\n[[pt-br:Rasengan Desaparecedor]]\n[[it:Rasengan Volatile]]\n[[es:Rasengan Desvanecido]]\n[[fr:Orbe Tourbillonnant Disparaissant]]\n[[pl:Kieru Rasengan]]\n[[ru:Исчезающий Расенган]]"
