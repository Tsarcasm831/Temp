Users control how long the wall lasts as well as how much water it's made with. Because the water is clear, the wall doesn't obstruct the user's vision, allowing them to make their next move uninhibited.<ref name=\"d2\"/> The wall's initial formation, if timed correctly, can be used to fend off opponents, flinging them away as the wall rises.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 461, page 2</ref> In the anime, the water can also be gathered midair, and dispersed in all directions as a form of fire-fighting,<ref>''Boruto'' episode 234</ref> or shot from one's hand.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 242</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Sasuke Shinden: The Teacher's Star Pupil|Sasuke Shinden]]'', [[Sasuke Uchiha]] creates the Water Formation Wall around his allies rather than around himself, providing them a shield while he carries out other tasks.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the manga, the [[hand seal]] sequence for this technique ends in the same seal that activates the [[Byakugan]].\n** In the anime, when Tobirama uses this technique, a different and far more elaborate set of hand seals is used, involving a unique seal of the right hand cupping the left hand with a thumbs-up.\n* In some video games, such as ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations]]'', Tobirama uses this technique offensively, sending geysers of water outward in front of him.\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Water Release: Pillar Encirclement]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[pl:Suiton: Suijinheki]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Água: Formação da Parede de Água]]\n[[de:Suiton: Suijinheki]]\n[[es:Elemento Agua: Muro de Agua]]\n[[fr:Suiton - Barrière d'Eau]]\n[[ru:Стихия Воды: Построение Водяной Стены]]"
