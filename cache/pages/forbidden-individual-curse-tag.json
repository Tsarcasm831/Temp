A direct strike to the heart appears to be able to remove the seal — albeit risking one's life in the process. According to [[Obito Uchiha]], the cursed seal also interfered with him becoming the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 675, pages 5-7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Both [[Rin Nohara]] and Obito Uchiha, who were branded with this cursed seal, had it removed by [[Kakashi Hatake]]'s [[Chidori]] and [[Lightning Cutter]] respectively, although Rin died while Obito survived by [[Six Paths Ten-Tails Coffin Seal|sealing]] the Ten-Tails into himself shortly after.\n* In the manga, the tag is black, with a [[Rinnegan]]-like symbol on it, while in the anime, it is white, with a red, white, and teal symbol.\n* While this seal prevented Obito from becoming a jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, no such hindrance existed for Rin becoming one for [[Isobu]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Talisman Maléfique Interdit Individuel]]\n[[pt-br:Etiqueta da Maldição Individual Proibida]]\n[[pl:Kinkoju no Fuda]]"
