Due to its structure, it acts in a similar manner to that of a [[shuriken]] when thrown by Susanoo — rapidly spinning towards the intended target — and results in an explosion upon impact. The size of these projectiles are dependent on the user, with smaller variations often used when fighting in close quarters or confined spaces.<ref name=\"C578P5\">''Naruto'' chapter 578, page 5</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 580, page 11</ref>\n\n== Variants ==\nWhile all operate in a somewhat similar manner, the technique can assume multiple forms that differ slightly both in appearance and use. These range from:\n\n* Three magatama bound together by a single, circular thread that are created either between two of Susanoo's hands or from just one,<ref name=\"C578P5\"/> which are then propelled towards the target as a single combined projectile.\n* A considerable number of magatama strung out between two of Susanoo's hands, using an interconnecting thread. These then detach themselves from one another once propelled towards the target, so that each magatama becomes a separate projectile.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 563, page 9</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThe {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Yasakani no Magatama|Yasakani no Magatama]]|八尺瓊曲玉|lit meaning=Eight [[Wikipedia:Shaku (unit)|Shaku]] Curved Jewel}} is one of the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Imperial Regalia of Japan|Three Imperial Regalia of Japan]]|三種の神器|Sanshu no Jingi}}, together with the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Kusanagi no Tsurugi|Kusanagi no Tsurugi]]|草薙劍|lit meaning=Grass-Mowing Sword}} and the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Yata no Kagami|Yata no Kagami]]|八咫鏡|lit meaning=Eight Span Mirror}}.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Itachi Uchiha]] mentions that the Yasaka Magatama is his strongest long-range technique.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 551, page 13</ref>\n* The shape of the single projectile variation of the Yasaka Magatama — three magatama bound together by a single circular line — is reminiscent of the completed form of the [[Sharingan]].\n{{-}}\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Blaze Release: Yasaka Magatama]]\n* [[Kamui Shuriken]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Projectiles Magiques de Yasaka]]\n[[pl:Yasaka no Magatama]]"
