Kurama has used this ability to find Naruto Uzumaki's [[Dark Naruto|inner hatred]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 496, page 10</ref> which has brought it close to breaking the [[Eight Trigrams Sealing Style|seal]] which contained it numerous times before Naruto took control of the fox's [[chakra]] himself.\n\nWhen Naruto achieved the [[Nine-Tails Chakra Mode]], he in turn gained access to this ability, aptly displayed when he uncovered [[Kisame Hoshigaki]] hiding within [[Samehada]] — even though Kisame and the sword both shared the same chakra signature.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 505, pages 9-10</ref> \n\n== Trivia ==\n* In [[The Iron Sand User: Shinki|''Boruto'' episode 61]], Naruto appears to sense the arrival of the [[Ōtsutsuki Clan]] members. It's unclear if he used this ability, since he had not entered his Chakra Mode.\n* Despite [[Minato Namikaze]] having mastered full control of Yin-Kurama sealed inside of him, he didn't demonstrate access to this technique.\n* Thanks to this technique, Naruto was key in weeding out the transformed [[White Zetsu Army]] clones that were wreaking havoc on the [[Allied Shinobi Forces]] during the first night of the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]].\n* In ''[[Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison]]'', [[Satori]] possessed a similar ability, though it could only sense fear.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Detección de Sentimientos Negativos]]\n[[fr:Détection d'Émotions Négatives]]\n[[pl:Wyczuwanie Negatywnych Emocji]]\n[[pt-br:Sensoriamento Negativo]]\n[[ru:Ощущение Отрицательных Эмоций]]"
