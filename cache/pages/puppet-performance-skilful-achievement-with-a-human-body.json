The person being manipulated gains the ability to not only use their own techniques, but the skills of the puppeteer as well.\n\nThe origins of this technique lie on the battlefield. When a puppeteer's puppets were all destroyed, they would begin using corpses. To perform this technique with a living person would normally require both parties to cooperate with each other. However, a highly skilled user can control the target by force if the person is severely weakened or damaged, rendering them unable to resist.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 517</ref>\n\nIn ''Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage'', [[Kankurō]] was able to combine this technique with his knowledge of the [[chakra pathway system]] to develop the ability to use the chakra threads to disrupt his victim's flow of chakra, thus hindering their ability to use techniques and causing them extreme pain.<ref>''Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage'', page 16</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In [[Intruders?!|chapter 34]],  Kankurō performed a similar manoeuvre to this to make [[Naruto]] trip.\n* In the anime, this technique is referred to as the {{translation|Dance of [[Sakura]]|サクラの舞|Sakura no Mai|engtv=Ninja Art: Sakura Puppet Dance}} when used on Sakura Haruno.\n* When Mukade used it in the [[Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower|movie]], the chakra threads wrapped around the [[Sāra|target's]] limbs instead of simply connecting to them. He was strong enough to force his victim to move to his will without weakening them beforehand.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hundred Puppet Soul Binding]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Ejecución de Marionetas: Control de Cuerpo Humano]]\n[[fr:Technique de Marionnette - Réalisation avec un Corps Humain]]\n[[pl:Sōen: Hitomi Gokū]]\n[[pt-br:Performance da Marionete: Conquista Habilidosa com um Corpo Humano]]"
