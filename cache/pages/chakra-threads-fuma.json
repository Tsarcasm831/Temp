The user creates threads of [[chakra]] that are used to connect the user's heart to another person's. As long as the two are connected, any internal damage done to one will also be done to the other. This ultimately means that, if one person dies, so will the other. Only a [[kunai]] wrapped in a special [[Fūma Clan (Land of Sound)|Fūma clan]] tag can safely cut the threads and separate the two.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* It is mentioned that the threads are so resilient that even [[Tsunade]], with her [[Chakra Enhanced Strength|fearsome strength]], cannot break them.\n\n[[es:Hilos de Chakra (Fūma)]]"
