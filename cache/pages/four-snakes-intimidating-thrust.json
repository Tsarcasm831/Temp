Three giant white snakes emerge from the ground in sequence, each biting his opponent, and in the end, four of those emerge behind Kabuto, raise themselves high, and lunge at his opponent.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The final part where the four snakes lunge at his opponent is similar to Kabuto's opening strike against [[Sasuke]] and [[Itachi]] in chapter [[Brothers, Fight Together!!|579]]."
