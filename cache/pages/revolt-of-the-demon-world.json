The chakra of the spirits is almost entirely [[spiritual energy]], causing them to ravenously seek out [[physical energy]] in order to achieve balance. Tayuya's melody directs the spirits at her targets, who they pursue in so complicated a pattern as to resemble dancing. When the spirits pass through the targets, they take bites of physical energy.<ref name=\"d2\"/> Because of their immaterial form, the spirits are impervious to direct attack. As such, the target's only chance of stopping the spirits is to either prevent Tayuya from playing her flute or to neutralise the Doki.<ref name=\"c207\">''Naruto'' chapter 207</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique being primarily composed of spiritual energy implies it may be [[Yin Release]].
