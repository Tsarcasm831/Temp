The user first creates two masses of Iron Sand of opposing magnetic fields and then merges them together. This causes the [[Magnet Release|magnetic forces]] to instantly increase and the repellent force created by the two opposing magnetic fields scatters the Iron Sand across a vast area.\n\nThe Iron Sand spreads in spikes that branch off irregularly, making it almost impossible to get a clear overview of what is happening. This also makes evading the spikes nearly impossible. Even if the opponent has managed to evade getting hit, the Iron Sand spikes will have filled the entire surroundings, cutting off any escape routes. With the opponent trapped, the user is free to attack in person.\n\nBecause Sasori coats his Iron Sand in his lethal [[poison]], the technique is even deadlier; if one of the spikes so much as scratches the target, it will introduce enough poison into the target's body to kill them.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Arena de Hierro: Orden Mundial]]\n[[fr:Monde de Limaille de Fer]]\n[[pl:Satetsu Kaihō]]\n[[pt-br:Ordem Mundial da Areia de Ferro]]"
