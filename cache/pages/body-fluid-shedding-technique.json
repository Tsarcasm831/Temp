This allows him to escape from bindings and regenerate from attacks. Due to these resulting trails of fluid, Kabuto can inhibit [[Sensor|sensing techniques]] from detecting him, such as [[dōjutsu]]. He can also liquefy his insides to prevent himself from experiencing the harmful effects of [[Sage Art: White Rage Technique|intense sound vibrations]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 580, page 4</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Segregación de Fluidos Corporales]]\n[[fr:Excrétion de Fluide Corporel]]\n[[pl:Technika Zrzucenia Płynnego Ciała]]"
