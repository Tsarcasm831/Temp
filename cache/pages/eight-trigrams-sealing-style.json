If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's [[chakra]] to merge with whoever they've been sealed into.<ref name=\"d1\"/> In the anime, this seal is intended to encourage [[tailed beast]]s to aid the [[jinchūriki]] they've been sealed within, as the more they provide chakra, the weaker the seal becomes, and thus the better their chance of freedom.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 327</ref>\n\n{{imgRight|8 Trigrams Seal Altar.png|The sealing altar.}}\n[[Minato Namikaze]] used the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style to seal the [[Nine-Tails]] into his infant son, [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. Before Minato performed the seal, he [[Summoning Technique|summon]]ed a ceremonial altar that he placed Naruto on.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 504, page 7</ref> Naruto's seal is located on his abdomen, but only becomes visible when he uses the Nine-Tails' chakra.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 91, pages 10-11</ref> As an additional safety measure, Minato also sealed the chakra of himself and Naruto's mother, [[Kushina Uzumaki]], into Naruto, who would appear before him under certain circumstances: Minato appears when the Nine-Tails nearly convinces Naruto to remove the seal, stops him from going through with it,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 439, page 17</ref> and then reinforces the seal;<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 440, page 15</ref> Kushina appears when Naruto is trying to replace the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style with a [[Torii Seal|new seal]], and gives him the support he needs to tame the Nine-Tails.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 498, pages 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Kurama's initial cage.png|thumb|left|The Nine-Tails within Naruto's subconscious.]]\nWhen Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways. The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising. The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 293, pages 2-5</ref> but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.<ref name=\"c95\">''Naruto'' chapter 95, pages 13-16</ref> The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with {{translation|\"seal\"|封}} written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.<ref name=\"c496\">''Naruto'' chapter 496, pages 10-13</ref> When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.<ref name=\"c95\"/>\n\n[[File:Hakke Fuin key.png|thumb|right|Naruto preparing the key to the seal.]]\nBecause the seal itself would naturally weaken over time, Minato created a key for it that can strengthen the seal when needed. He inscribed the key on the abdomen of the scroll [[toad]], [[Gerotora]], and sent it to [[Jiraiya]] for safekeeping. Jiraiya, believing that Minato wanted Naruto to use the Nine-Tails against [[Tobi|some threat]], instead uses the key to slightly weaken the seal, giving Naruto greater access to the Nine-Tails' chakra.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 370, pages 7-17</ref> After this key is passed to Naruto, he uses it to remove the seal in preparation for replacing it with a stronger one.<ref name=\"c496\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to [[Killer B]], this seal is of higher quality than the [[Iron Armour Seal]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 496, page 7</ref>\n* In the manga, after [[Tailed Beast Transfer Technique|transferring]] the chakra of [[Kurama]]'s Yin-half into an incapacitated Naruto Uzumaki, [[Obito Uchiha]] was also shown reestablishing this seal.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 666, page 16</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Orochimaru]] suited [[Mecha-Naruto]] with this seal in order to take the Nine-Tails from Naruto.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 376</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Uzumaki clan| ]]\n\n[[de:Hakke no Fuuin Shiki]]\n[[fr:Sceau du Hakke]]\n[[id:Segel 8 Trigam]]\n[[pl:Hakke no Fūin Shiki]]\n[[pt-br:Fórmula do Selo de Oito Trigramas]]"
