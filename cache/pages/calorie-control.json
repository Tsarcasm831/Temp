Akimichi who are less experienced with this technique make use of the [[Three Coloured Pills]] to initiate this process, however, these pills have the adverse effect of converting all the calories in the user's body to chakra. Once perfected, however, the Akimichi no longer has need for the pills and can regulate how much of their body weight is converted at any given time.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Because of the high amounts of chakra that their clan techniques usually consume, Akimichi tend to eat in direct proportion to that. Members of the clan are usually described as being gluttonous as a result.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Clan::Akimichi clan| ]]\n\n[[es:Control de Calorías]]\n[[fr:Contrôle des Calories]]\n[[pl:Karorī Kontorōru]]\n[[pt-br:Controle de Calorias]]"
