Sasuke can also use this technique to escape from restraints and bind an opponent in his place,<ref name=\"BE65\">''Boruto'' episode 65</ref> or to discard any foreign weapons embedded in his body.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 38, pages 9-10</ref> Despite this technique stemming from his Rinnegan, Sasuke does not actually need to be looking at an object in order to swap places with it.<ref>''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''</ref>\n\nSasuke can also target other objects and individuals with this technique in order to shift them to another space in his surroundings.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 682, page 9</ref> This allows him to transport a weapon into his hand, or to project one of his techniques, such as the [[Chidori]], to a remote location.<ref name=\"BE65\"/> By launching an attack and then bringing his opponent to him at the last possible moment, Sasuke can ensure that his techniques hit their mark.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, pages 11-13</ref> However, the opponent must be within a certain range of him for this to take effect, and with sufficient speed, it is possible to escape this technique's range before it can be activated.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 674, page 14</ref> While storing the [[chakra]] of the nine [[tailed beasts]] within his [[Susanoo]], Sasuke demonstrated the ability to shift both himself and his Susanoo behind [[Naruto Uzumaki]], who was a considerable distance away.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 696, pages 8-10</ref>\n\nUpon first obtaining his Rinnegan, Sasuke had to wait for his eye to recharge after using this technique several times in quick succession,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 687, page 4</ref> and further overuse would cause his eye to bleed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 686, page 14</ref> In adulthood, Sasuke is able to use this technique even while his Rinnegan's ocular power is diminished due to using its [[Sasuke Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu|other abilities]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 700+6, page 3</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 700+8, page 17</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThis technique's name comes from [[Wikipedia:Ame-no-tajikarao|Ame-no-tajikarao]], the Japanese deity who used his brute strength to pull [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] out of the [[Wikipedia:Amano-Iwato|cave]] where she was hiding from her [[Wikipedia:Susanoo-no-Mikoto|brother]], thus returning sunlight to the world. The technique's workings may be derived from the Iwato dance of the Sada Shrine; after Ame-no-tajikarao opens the cave and Amaterasu emerges, he takes her place inside the cave.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to Sasuke, this technique is a result of being blessed with the Sage of Six Paths' power.<ref name=\"ch681\">''Naruto'' chapter 681, page 3</ref>\n* Despite being a space–time ninjutsu rather than accelerated movement, [[Naruto Uzumaki]] once described this technique as being similar to the [[Body Flicker Technique]].<ref name=\"ch681\"/>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Body Replacement Technique]]\n* [[Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique]]\n* [[Flying Thunder God Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Amenotejikara]]\n[[id:Amenotejikara]]\n[[pt-br:Ame-no-Tejikara]]\n[[pl:Amenotejikara]]\n[[ru:Аменотеджикара]]"
