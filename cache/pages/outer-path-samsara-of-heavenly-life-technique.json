These souls may be recalled from even the crossroad between life and the [[Pure Land|afterlife]], and are then returned to their rejuvenated bodies. The exact limitations of this technique are unknown, but on one occasion, it was able to resurrect a large number of individuals who had recently died. While using this technique, the caster is severely weakened; for instance, [[Nagato]]'s hair turned white as a result of overexerting his power.<ref name=\"ch449\">''Naruto'' chapter 449</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 510, page 17</ref> Ultimately, once the technique is finished, the user invariably dies.<ref name=\"c614\">''Naruto'' chapter 614, pages 5-6</ref>\n\nThis technique can also be used to transform the corpse vessel of an individual revived by [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation]] into a real body of living flesh and blood.<ref name=\"c656\">''Naruto'' chapter 656, pages 14-17</ref> However, whereas the rest of the reincarnated [[Madara Uchiha]]'s body was made real, his [[Rinnegan|eyes]] instead crumbled into dust upon his resurrection. This method does not require the King of Hell to appear.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 657, page 1</ref>\n\nThe revived individuals are seemingly revived with a fully restored chakra level, as Kakashi did not require hospitalization to recover after revival, and was able to carry Naruto after he nearly passes out after his fight with Pain.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* When written as '輪廻転生', ''Rinne Tensei'' means \"the circle of transmigration\" or \"metempsychosis\".\n* [[Hashirama Senju]] identified this technique as a {{translation|''Six Paths Kinjutsu''|六道の禁術|Rikudō no Kinjutsu|lit meaning=Six Paths Forbidden Technique}}.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 637, page 2</ref>\n* When Nagato was preparing to use this technique, [[Konan]] feared for the worst due to his low chakra levels, implying she believed he could have potentially survived with more chakra.<ref name=\"ch449\"/> However, according to the [[Jin no Sho|fourth databook]], usage of this technique always comes at the cost of the user's life.<ref name=d4/>\n* Madara — and [[Obito]] under the guise of Madara — noted that this technique was supposed to be used to revive him.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 453, page 18</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 601, page 11</ref> Madara would eventually be revived by Impure World Reincarnation instead, and expressed surprise and disappointment that his return didn't go as planned, as only a living person can become the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 559, pages 1-2</ref><ref name=\"c614\"/> Eventually, [[Black Zetsu]] successfully [[Body Coating|forced]] Obito to perform this technique on Madara.<ref name=\"c656\"/> Obito was then able to temporarily survive the effects of using this technique due to Black Zetsu attaching to his body.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 657, page 10</ref> After this, Naruto temporarily stabilised Obito's life force using his [[Six Paths Yang Power]] like he did with [[Might Guy]] after he used the [[Eight Gates Released Formation]], allowing him to bring back Sasuke and later battle against [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]]. However, as the both noted, Obito would still die as a result from using this technique.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Gedo: Arte Rinne de la Reencarnación]]\n[[fr:Statue de l'Hérétique - Cycle Éternel des Réincarnations]]\n[[ka:გარეთა გზა: ზეციური სიცოცხლის სამსარას ტექნიკა]]\n[[pl:Gedō — Rinne Tensei no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Caminho Exterior: Técnica da Reencarnação Rinne]]"
