This mist is highly acidic in nature, capable of melting bodies, and even chakra-based defences and barriers, nullifying them. Even [[Sasuke Uchiha]]'s [[Susanoo]] was affected, despite being considered an \"absolute defence\".<ref name =\"d4\" /> The technique has an inherent disadvantage in that its effects are indiscriminate, limiting its usage to areas that do not contain allies. In the event that the mist escapes the containment area, the user can adjust the [[Wikipedia:pH|pH level]] of the mist to safer levels.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 466, page 12</ref>\n\nThough the mist is corrosive to all around it, the user seems to be immune to it, as Mei used it in an enclosed area without endangering herself.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Vapor: Jutsu de Niebla Corrosiva]]\n[[fr:Futton - Brume Acide]]\n[[pl:Futton: Kōmu no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Ebulição: Técnica da Névoa Qualificada]]"
