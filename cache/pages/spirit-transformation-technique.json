By taking possession of a target, the spirit can suppress and collapse the victim's spirit, killing them, or freely manipulate their actions. This technique can also be used to communicate information or transfer [[chakra]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 591, pages 7-13</ref> This technique will always reach the intended target, even when their whereabouts are unknown to the user. Having become a living ghost, the spirit has no substance and cannot be affected by enemy attacks.<ref name=\"db4\" />\n\nWith the release of the [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation]] technique, a reincarnated Dan was capable of taking control of his ascending spirit for a short period of time using this technique. Dan Katō noted that this technique had been used to kill a great number of shinobi during his lifetime<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 591, pages 6-7</ref> and that the only way to counteract the technique is to trap the user within a barrier, such as the [[Four Violet Flames Formation]], before it is activated.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 530, page 7</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Dan's ability to cause his soul to exit his body makes him reminiscent of an {{translation|\"[[Wikipedia:Ikiryō|ikiryō]]\"|生霊|lit meaning=living ghost}}, from Japanese folklore. An ikiryō is a person whose soul can dwell outside his or her body.\n* [[Tobirama Senju]] is capable of using a similar technique, where he can send his soul into [[Sasuke Uchiha|another]] person's body if they were still alive, but unlike this technique, it is labelled a [[kinjutsu]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 663, page 8</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Mind Body Switch Technique]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Technique de Spiritualisation]]\n[[pl:Reika no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Transformação em Espírito]]\n[[uk:Техніка Трансформації Духу]]"
