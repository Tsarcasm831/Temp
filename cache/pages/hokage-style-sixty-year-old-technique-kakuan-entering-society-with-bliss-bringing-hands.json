The user produces the {{translation|\"sit\"|座|za}} kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its [[jinchūriki]] with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 296, pages 15-16</ref> \n\nWhen Yamato used this technique to suppress [[Naruto Uzumaki]]'s [[Jinchūriki Forms#Version 2|four-tailed form]], Naruto needed to be in possession of the [[First Hokage's Necklace]] to aid in suppressing the [[Nine-Tails]]' chakra.\n\nWhen [[Hashirama]] used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinchūriki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the [[tailed beast control]] through his [[Wood Release: Wood Human Technique]], which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast [[Genjutsu: Sharingan|controlled]] by the [[Sharingan]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 626, page 8</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n{{translation|\"Jijun\"|耳順}} is a Japanese term used for people in their sixties. It comes from a saying by Confucius, {{translation|liùshí ér ěrshùn (Mandarin Chinese)|六十而耳順}}, that is most commonly translated long the lines of \"At sixty, my ear was obedient\", meaning that at age sixty, one is able to hear all things without being unhappy about them.\n\nThe last part of this technique's name, {{translation|\"Kakuan Nitten Suishu\"|廓庵入鄽垂手}}, comes from a famous series of short poems and accompanying images, called the {{translation|\"[[Wikipedia:Ten Bulls|Ten Bull Pictures]]\"|十牛図（十牛圖）|Jūgyū-zu|(Mandarin) Chinese: ''Shíniútú''}}. The pictures and poems are intended to illustrate the stages of Zen discipline.\n\nThey were drawn by a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master called {{translation|Kuòān|廓庵|Japanese: Kakuan}}. The tenth poem talks about how the fully-enlightened herdsman returns to the city to help others reach enlightenment. This poem is called {{translation|Rùchán Chuíshǒu (Mandarin Chinese)|入鄽垂手|Japanese: Nitten Suishu}}, which can be translated as ''\"entering society with bliss-bringing hands\"'' (i.e. hands that teach how to reach enlightenment).\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In [[The Directive to Take the Nine-Tails|''Shippūden'' episode 376]], when Yamato is performing this technique to suppress Kurama's chakra from leaking out of Naruto, he got motion sickness from riding the ever-shaking palanquin. As a gag, the kanji on Yamato's hand changed to {{Translation|\"drunken\"|酔|yo|}}, as he was on the verge of vomiting.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Destruction of Evil Seal]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n__NOTOC__\n\n[[es:Estilo Hokage: Jutsu de Sumisión: Regreso al Estado Humano de Kakuan]]\n[[fr:Arcanes du Hokage – Six Décennies – Rempart du Retour à la Source]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica Sexagenária do Estilo Hokage: Kakuan Entrando na Sociedade com Mãos Trazendo Felicidade]]\n[[pl:Hokage-Shiki Jijun Jutsu — Kakuan Nitten Suishu]]"
