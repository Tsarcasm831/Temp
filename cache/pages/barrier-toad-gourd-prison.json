By using the toad's tongue to drag in whatever it wraps around, this technique is best used to capture and isolate a victim dragging them into the toad's stomach. Isolated from the outside world by a barrier, the dimension sealed inside the Gourd Toad's stomach is far larger than the size of the Gourd Toad itself. Even if at a moment's notice, only the technique's caster can freely enter and exit the isolated space. Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command.\n\nThe environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive [[Wikipedia:Gastric acid|gastric acid]] that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake. Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Barrera: Prisión de Sapo Calabaza]]\n[[fr:Barrière Magique - Prison-Gourde du Crapaud]]\n[[pl:Kekkai: Gama Hyōrō]]"
