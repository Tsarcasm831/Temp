After sucking up sweat, it is then mixed with saliva to create a bubble from their mouth that lets them conceal natural body odour of their allies and themselves. \n\nA variation of this technique is done to fool enemies by producing many small bubbles of user's own smell by following same method and scattering it over a wide area. Except in this technique the user doesn't take scents of their allies and the bubbles do not conceal the smell.\n\n[[fr:Bulle d'Occultation d'Odeur]]\n[[pl:Bańki Ukrywające Zapach]]"
