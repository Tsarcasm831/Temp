Boasting greater power than the Super Beast Imitating Drawing, each creation can quickly deliver deadly blows capable of easily destroying stone and the terrain. Because these drawings draw on the emotions of the user, the angrier they become, the more powerful the drawings become.\n\nAgainst [[Magire]], Sai was able to strip the former of his [[Version 1|chakra cloak]] and knock him unconscious with a single blow. Likewise, he was able to overpower and even throw the [[Gatekeeper]] a considerable distance.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The drawings are known as the {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Nio|Benevolent Kings]]|仁王|Niō}} or {{translation|[[Wikipedia:Vajra|Vajra]] Strongmen|金剛力士|Kongō Rikishi}}.\n* During the [[Fourth Shinobi World War]], Sai's two giants were known as {{translation|Agyō|阿形|Agyō}} and {{translation|Ungyō|吽形|Ungyō}}. In ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and ''[[Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze]]'', the humanoids are named after [[Wikipedia:Fūjin|Fūjin]] — the god of wind, and [[Wikipedia:Raijin|Raijin]] — the god of thunder, and are now much larger.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Toile aux Divinités Fantomatiques]]\n[[pl:Chōshin Giga]]\n[[pt-br:Desenho de Imitação do Super Deus]]"
