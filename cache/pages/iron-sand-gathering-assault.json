The weight and size of these shapes are so great, they can easily shatter bedrock and break through most defences with a single hit.\n\nBecause the weapon is made out of Iron Sand, the shape can be whatever the user wants, and can even be changed during the fight. This allows the user to create the best weapon for the fight, by taking into account the opponent's abilities and the surrounding environment. Since the Iron Sand generates a strong [[Magnet Release|magnetic field]], the opponent cannot use any metal weapons or tools.\n{{-}}\n\n== Weapons ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n!style=\"width:20%\"|Shape\n!style=\"width:30%\"|Name\n!style=\"width:50%\"|Description\n|-\n|[[File:Iron Sand Spear.png|240px]]\n|{{translation|Iron Sand Spear|砂鉄槍|Satetsusō}}<ref>''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5''</ref><br>{{translation|Giant Spear|巨大槍|Kyodaisō}}<ref name=\"SnS\" /><br>{{translation|Edge|鋭|Ei}}<ref>''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact''</ref> \n|This large, triangular shaped weapon allows the user to penetrate through defences as strong as rock. It can be spun to pick it up even more power, giving it a drill-like appearance. It can also be shaped into a thinner, but longer version of it to increase its range.\n|-\n|[[File:Iron Sand Five Sun Nail.png|240px]]\n|{{translation|Five [[Wikipedia:Cun (unit)|Sun]] Nails|五寸釘|Gosunkugi}}<ref name=\"UNS2\">''Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2''</ref>\n|Besides being capable of penetrating through someone's body, these long spikes can be used to attack multiple targets.
