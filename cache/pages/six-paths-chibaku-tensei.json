The target is then made into a centre of attraction, causing the surrounding earth to be forcefully pulled onto their body and formed into a sealing stone far larger than what is created by the standard [[Chibaku Tensei]]. The technique can also seal away the target's [[Rinne Sharingan]], as images of the Six Paths Yin and Yang seals appear within their eye and overlap,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 690</ref> as well as forcibly extract their [[chakra]] from their body.{{Citation needed}} The only known method of breaking this seal is for a wielder of the [[Rinnegan]] to [[Summoning Technique|summon]] the core out of the resulting [[wikipedia:natural satellite|satellite]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 606, page 14</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Hamura and Hagoromo seal Kaguya.png|thumb|left|Hagoromo and Hamura sealing the Ten-Tails.]]\n[[Hagoromo]] and [[Hamura Ōtsutsuki]] used this technique on the [[Ten-Tails]], sealing its [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path|body]] within the newly-created [[moon]]. Centuries later, the spirit of Hagoromo passed on the seals required to activate this technique to [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Sasuke Uchiha]], who went on to perform the same feat, resealing [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]] — alongside [[Black Zetsu]] — inside of a new moon contained within her [[Kaguya's Dimensions|core dimension]].\n{{-L}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In [[Kaguya's Tears|chapter 681]], the [[Jin no Sho|fourth databook]], and ''[[Naruto: Shippūden]]'' [[She of the Beginning|episode 459]], it is stated that Hagoromo and Hamura used this technique to transform the Ten-Tails into the core of the moon. However, in [[A Fabricated Past|episode 462]], they are instead depicted using this technique on Kaguya herself, while Ten-Tails' body withers away like a tree. Later, in [[Ninshū: The Ninja Creed|episode 464]], Hagoromo claims he sealed both Kaguya and Ten-Tails inside the moon.\n** In the anime, when Hagoromo and Hamura used this technique to seal Kaguya, the Six Paths Yin and Yang seals did not appear in her [[Rinne Sharingan|third eye]], and her chakra was not extracted from her body.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Astre de Rikudô]]\n[[pl:Rikudō — Chibaku Tensei]]\n[[pt-br:Seis Caminhos: Chibaku Tensei]]\n[[tr:Altı Yol - Chibaku Tensei]]"
