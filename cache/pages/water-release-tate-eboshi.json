Suigetsu can use this form to battle larger opponents, or he can use it to shield allies from attack. Though it was strong enough to physically push back [[Killer B]] in his [[Tailed Beast Mode]], it was not strong enough to withstand a point-blank range [[Tailed Beast Ball]], and rendered Suigetsu unconscious soon afterwards, causing him to fall into a jelly-like state.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Tate-eboshi is tall and straight eboshi.
