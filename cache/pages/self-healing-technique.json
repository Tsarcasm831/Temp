The core can be moved around the body via hand seals, lowering the chances of its destruction.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 41, pages 28-36</ref> The negative effect of using the core, should it be removed as the body became modified to depend on it for stability, the user's body will mutate uncontrollably.\n\nWhile stated to possess a regenerative ability in the manga, Victor's usage was never shown until the anime.<ref name=\"BE175\">''Boruto'' episode 175</ref> Similar to Boro's usage, Victor is capable of regenerating limbs and his head. If a limb is severed, Victor can manipulate the limb or use his blood as tendrils to retrieve and immediately reattach it.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 173</ref> However, Victor's regeneration is not perfect as it is not capable of keeping up with [[True Fire of Samadhi|inextinguishable Fire Release techniques]].<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 16, page 15</ref> Also, since Victor utilised a [[cursed seal]] to extend his life, prolonged usage of this technique would accelerate Victor's decline in health, as his over-usage led to his permanent loss of his right eye and leg and likewise leaves him extremely drained.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 179</ref>\n\nThe efficiency of this technique depends on the user's skills, as neither Victor nor Orochimaru required hand seals to perform it, but while Victor's usage was considered imperfect, Orochimaru's did not show such flaws. While Boro seems to be devoid of the flaws that Victor had, he was dependent on the core within his body to stabilise his regenerative powers, and he seemingly required to perform seals to purge the poison out of his body.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Several sources referred to this technique as {{translation|\"Self-Regeneration Technique\"|自己再生術|Jiko Saiseijutsu}}. Whether it is proper name or just a description of the type of technique is still unclear.<ref name=\"BE175\" /><ref>[https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/boruto/episodes/ TV Tokyo ''Boruto'' Official Website]</ref>\n* While this technique does not regenerate clothing, in the anime when Victor's head was bitten off by one of Orochimaru's snakes, his eyepatch was included on his new head.\n* In the anime, Boro claimed to his [[Ōtsutsuki Cult|followers]] that he gained this power (regarding it as an \"indestructible body\") from a [[Isshiki Ōtsutsuki|\"God\"]] he met.<ref name=\"BE202\">''Boruto'' episode 202</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Body Revival Technique]]\n* [[Creation Rebirth]]\n* [[Medical Water Release: Jellyfish]]\n* [[Ultra-Fast Regeneration Technique]]\n* [[Yin Healing Wound Destruction]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Technique d'Auto-Régénération]]\n[[ru:Техника Самовосстановления]]"
