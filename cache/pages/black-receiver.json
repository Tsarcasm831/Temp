He then told [[Obito Uchiha]] to use it when performing the [[Six Paths Technique]].<ref name=\"ch606\"/>\n* Black rods have been seen protruding from the Demonic Statue's midsection at times.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 512, pages 8-9</ref> On one occasion, these rods pierced [[Nagato]]'s back and drained him of his life force,<ref>''[[Jin no Sho]]'', page 247</ref> which allowed him to control the statue.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 447, pages 8-13</ref>\n* Black rods have sprouted from Obito's [[Hashirama's Artificial Body|artificial right half]] on several occasions: upon first awakening his [[Mangekyō Sharingan]] and using [[Wood Release]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 605, page 6</ref> when Madara used the rods to control his actions,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 636, pages 15-17</ref> and when [[Black Zetsu]] first [[Body Coating|coated]] his body and forced him to [[Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique|revive]] Madara.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 656, pages 16-17</ref>\n* When Obito was the [[Ten-Tails]]' [[jinchūriki]], he converted one of his [[Truth-Seeking Ball]]s into six black receivers, which he used to activate the [[Six Red Yang Formation]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 643, pages 9-11</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Nagato Transmitting Chakra.png|thumb|left|Rods transmitting chakra.]]\nBlack receivers are formed out of chakra,<ref>''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' novelisation, chapter 5</ref> which takes on a consistency similar to metal. They are durable enough to break steel scalpels,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 418, page 14</ref> as well as sharp enough to pierce through human bodies with ease.<ref name=\"ch381\">''Naruto'' chapter 381, page 1</ref> Though durable, the rods can still be destroyed when struck with sufficient force,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 433, page 7</ref> and their creator is able to break them apart without any apparent difficulty.<ref name=\"ch437\">''Naruto'' chapter 437, page 6</ref> Once formed, the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 436, pages 3-4</ref> Though chakra being sent to these receivers can be [[Sensor Type|sensed]], a skilled user can prevent their location from being discovered by constantly changing the frequency of their chakra.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 435, pages 11-12</ref> Offensively employing receivers from afar carries a risk, as those with sensing capabilities can trace the transmitted chakra back to the user when pierced with one.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 441, pages 12-15</ref> When receiving chakra, the black rods noticeably heat up.<ref name=\"ch420\"/>\n\n{{ImgRight|Disruption Blade Effect.png|The user transmits chakra into the victim's body.}}\nBy stabbing an opponent with the rods, the user can transmit their chakra into the target's body, disrupting their own chakra and throwing off their movements.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 381, page 3</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 420, pages 8-9</ref> The user can fully immobilise the target by stabbing them with multiple rods,<ref name=\"ch437\"/> as well as prevent them from moulding additional chakra by piercing their [[tenketsu]].<ref name=\"ch661\"/> Provided the user is close enough, they can potentially control the target's movements, though this can be resisted if the target's own chakra is powerful enough.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 444, pages 3-4</ref> Aside from being stabbed, simply touching the receivers can apparently also incur negative effects,<ref name=\"ch661\"/> though Rinnegan wielders are seemingly immune.<ref name=\"ch673\">''Naruto'' chapter 673, page 9</ref>\n\nChakra receivers are also used to control the [[Six Paths of Pain]]: six reanimated corpses that possess copies of the Rinnegan, granting them a shared field of vision with their creator. Nagato controlled his Six Paths of Pain using numerous receivers fashioned into piercings, which were implanted all about their bodies,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 421, page 15</ref> whereas Obito had a single rod implanted in each body's chest.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 565, pages 9-11</ref> Among other Rinnegan abilities, the bodies are capable of producing additional rods to serve as weapons.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 378, page 1</ref> As they are controlled by the user's chakra, opponents can prevent these bodies from moving by removing all of their receivers.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 443, pages 3-4</ref> The receivers implanted in Obito's Six Paths of Pain doubled as a means of temporarily binding the chakra of the [[tailed beasts]] sealed inside the Demonic Statue to their bodies, making them into jinchūriki.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 570, page 4</ref> When they entered [[Tailed Beast Mode]], the receivers would relocate from the jinchūriki's chests up to the tailed beasts' necks.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 569, pages 5-6</ref> The creatures Nagato [[Summoning Rinnegan|summoned]] through the [[Animal Path]] were also embedded with numerous receivers, suggesting he controlled them in a similar manner.\n\n[[File:Chakra Receiver stakes.png|thumb|left|Chakra chains manifested through giant stakes.]]\nWhen employed offensively, the black rods make for effective weapons. They can emerge from the user's hand to stab opponents,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 636, page 5</ref> be broken off and wielded like swords,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 442, pages 7-9</ref> or be launched as high-speed projectiles,<ref name=\"boruto\">''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]''</ref> and the size and shape of the generated receivers can be adjusted to fit the situation.<ref name=\"ch381\"/> Obito is shown employing black receivers fashioned into giant stakes as projectiles, [[Kamui|ejecting]] them from [[Kamui's dimension]] to pierce and pin targets.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 598, pages 9-10</ref> He can also manifest [[Demonic Statue Chains|chakra chains]] to bind those touching the receivers with an even greater binding power.<ref name=\"ch569\">''Naruto'' chapter 569, page 10</ref> In the anime, the user can also apply [[shape transformation]] to the rods after launching them, altering them into more elaborate forms.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 135</ref>\n\nBlack receivers disintegrate when their creator is killed or similarly incapacitated, alongside any Truth-Seeking Balls they may possess.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 680, pages 10-11</ref><ref name=\"boruto\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Obito implied the binding power of the black rods is related to the [[Outer Path]].<ref name=\"ch569\"/> However, Madara was able to use their binding power even after losing his Rinnegan.<ref name=\"ch657\"/>\n* Similar to Truth-Seeking Balls, black receivers appear to hinder the regenerative qualities of [[Impure World Reincarnation]] to some extent, as the wounds of reincarnated individuals do not immediately heal while the rods are pierced through their bodies,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 661, page 13</ref> though they do eventually heal.<ref name=\"ch673\"/>\n* [[Naruto Uzumaki]] used something similar to black receivers when he [[Shape Transformation|shaped]] his Truth-Seeking Balls into rods and used them to immobilise Madara and Black Zetsu.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 675, pages 10-11</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 688, page 6</ref>\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble]]'', Pain's [[Black Needle Stab]] temporarily reverses the controls of those stabbed by his black rods.\n* [[Isshiki Ōtsutsuki]] has employed similar tools; however, they're different in that Isshiki has no Rinnegan, and they function differently. His absorb chakra instead of transmitting his own to disrupt the chakra of those it pierces.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 36, page 34</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Récepteur de Chakra]]\n[[pl:Czarny Odbiornik]]\n[[pt-br:Receptor Negro]]"
