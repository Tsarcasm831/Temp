While contained within the device, the senbon are immersed in a poison potent enough to leave victims near-death from a mere scratch. The device is fired by pulling an attached string, which quickly shoots the five senbon at any target Shizune aims at. Because of how the device is configured, the senbon cannot be fired individually. However, by channeling her [[chakra]] into the string, Shizune can alter the trajectory of the senbon, either to concentrate them on one point, spread them over a larger area, or even change the direction of the senbon from what the device is aimed at. Shizune generally uses this as a surprise attack, as the device is hidden by her sleeve, is not bulky enough to be noticed, and furthermore she does not give the impression of being able to fight, thus lowering an opponent's guard.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n==Trivia==\n* Shizune has also been shown spitting senbon from her mouth,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 165</ref> but ''[[Tō no Sho]]'' gives no indication of it being this technique.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Tiro de Agujas Preparadas]]\n[[fr:Tir d'Aiguilles Chargées]]\n[[pl:Shikomishindan]]\n[[pt-br:Tiro Preparado de Agulhas]]"
