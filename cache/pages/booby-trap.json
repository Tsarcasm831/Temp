After the victim approaches the trap, it explodes, firing at the unfortunate.\n* In the anime, Konohamaru Sarutobi hid pepper bombs, heavy metal basins and other objects in the ceiling above the door, which fell on people trying to break down the door.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Shinobi no Sato no Jintori Kassen]]'', it is a counterattack from Sakura, where she cuts a [[Wire Strings|wire]] to make a log hit the incoming opponent.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja]]'' and ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2]]'', Booby Trap is a set of two techniques: Sakura starts with {{translation|'''Log Drop'''|丸太落とし|Marutaotoshi|'''Deathly Tree Trap''' in English games}}, where an opponent running on her direction trips on the wire from her trap and is hit by a log. If successful, she follows with {{translation|'''Falling Rock Warning'''|落石注意|Chikusekichūi}}, cutting a wire to make multiple rocks fall on the target.\n* In ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', Sakura makes four blocks of wood fall around her. It has a stronger version named {{translation|'''Booby Trap Second Style'''|ブービートラップ二式|Būbītorappu Nishiki}} that makes three large tree logs fall around her.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2]]'', Sakura simply tricks the enemy, and they either get paralysed or fall asleep.\n* In ''[[Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'', Sakura places a trap on the ground. If the opponent trips it, a large mine falls on them.\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing]]'', Rin Nohara throws tree trunks with [[explosive tag]]s attached to the enemy, which explode after pinning her target down.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This attack is based on [[The Beautiful Wild Beast…!!|the traps]] set by Sakura during the [[Chūnin Exams]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu: Trampa Boba]]\n[[fr:Piège à Idiots]]\n[[pl:Būbītorappu]]\n[[pt-br:Cilada]]\n[[ru:Мина-Ловушка]]"
