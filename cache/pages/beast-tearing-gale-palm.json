It uses [[chakra]] to infuse with and condense a mass amount of wind-chakra to form a massive demonic-like claw extending from the user's hand to strike and grab a target, as well as deflect any weapon or attack. Depending on its use, the user can manipulate the size and length of the claw to attack and defend at any range. In addition to making it a deadly weapon, the extending claw also carries tremendous force that can devastate anything in its path without affecting the user, making it useful for dislodging solid and heavy objects.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Tailed Beast Chakra Arms]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Viento: Palma de Ola Violenta de Viento Bestial]]\n[[pl:Jūha Reppū Shō]]"
