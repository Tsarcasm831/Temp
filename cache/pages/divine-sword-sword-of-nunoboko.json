Utilising the flight ability acquired through [[Six Paths Senjutsu]], the user soars above the adversary and channels their power into transforming their [[shakujō]] into the formidable [[Sword of Nunoboko]]. With precision, the weapon is thrust into the ground, piercing through the target and triggering a shockwave infused with black and purple hues. This manoeuvre inflicts substantial damage upon the opponent.\n\n[[pt-br:Espada Divina: Espada de Nunoboko]]\n[[pl:Shinken: Nunoboko no Ken]]"
