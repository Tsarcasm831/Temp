[[Haku]] creates several large mirrors out of [[ice]], which he surrounds a target with.<ref name=\"d1\"/> By entering one of these mirrors,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 24</ref> Haku's reflection will appear in all of them. Haku can travel between these mirrors near-instantaneously, giving the appearance that he occupies all of them simultaneously. As such, any attacks he makes from these mirrors - usually rapid volleys of thrown [[senbon]] - can overwhelm opponents, seemingly coming from every mirror at once.<ref name=\"d1\"/> Using the technique requires a great deal of [[chakra]] from Haku, meaning he cannot use it indefinitely.<ref name=\"c27\">''Naruto'' chapter 27, pages 4-5</ref> In the anime, if the mirror the user is in is broken, they can leap out of one of the fragments and continue their attack or move to another mirror.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 17</ref>\n\nAlthough Haku moves between the mirrors extremely quickly, to the point that ''[[Rin no Sho]]'' describes it as [[wikipedia:light speed|light speed]],<ref name=\"d1\"/> it is still possible to track him: [[Sasuke Uchiha]], with his undeveloped [[Sharingan]], becomes able to follow his movements, and with enough time could even attack Haku;<ref name=\"c27\"/> [[Naruto Uzumaki]], after entering an [[initial jinchūriki form]], is able to dodge Haku as well.<ref name=\"c28\">''Naruto'' chapter 28</ref> Similarly, although the mirrors are quite resilient, notably not melting against standard [[Fire Release]],<ref name=\"c25\">''Naruto'' chapter 25</ref> Naruto's jinchūriki form is strong enough to shatter one.<ref name=\"c28\"/> The mirrors will also shatter if Haku stops maintaining them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 524</ref>\n\nThese exceptions aside, the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals is still a formidable technique. Most victims will be unable to do anything against Haku's attacks, as they are so fast and come from so many directions at once that it's impossible to see all of them. If they should try to attack Haku while he's within a mirror, he can simply move to another mirror before they've even noticed.<ref name=\"d1\"/> If Haku completely surrounds his victims with mirrors, such as the dome he uses against Sasuke, then they are effectively trapped; only allies working from outside the dome stand a reasonable chance of saving them.<ref name=\"c25\"/> Even targets who manage to keep their distance from Haku are not safe, as he can simply form a mirror next to them, allowing him to quickly travel to and attack them.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 521, pages 11-12</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The full name of this technique is {{translation|\"Secret Technique: Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals\"|秘術・魔鏡氷晶|Hijutsu: Makyō Hyōshō}}.\n* The technique specific seal for this jutsu closely resembles the hand seal for the real life Kuji-in seal of Pyō (兵) which has the middle fingers hooked over the index fingers and touching, the only difference being that the remaining four fingers are curled inward with the fingernails not showing.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[fr:Démoniaques Miroirs de Glace]]\n[[pl:Makyō Hyōshō]]\n[[pt-br:Espelhos Demoníacos de Cristais de Gelo]]\n[[ru:Демонические зеркала из ледяных кристаллов]]"
