The openings can be used to connect two different spatial locations within the same dimension, or to create a pathway that links two dimensions together.<section end=summary /> By entering these spacial tears, the user is able to retreat, disorient enemies, or execute ambush attacks at a moment's notice. [[Kaguya Ōtsutsuki]] used this technique to travel between her [[Kaguya's Dimensions|six dimensions]].\n\nThese portals can be used to transport only sections of the user's body by partially entering them, allowing the user to grab their opponents and drag them into the portal, sending them to another location. Kaguya can also open rifts to transport her attacks through the portals, relocating projectiles and ultimately taking the enemy down by surprise.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 684, page 15-16</ref> The portals are manifested at such speeds that even a shinobi as fast as [[Sasuke Uchiha]] was caught off guard.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 682, page 15</ref> However, evading the portals is still possible.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 683, page 2</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* [[Wikipedia:Yomotsu Hirasaka|Yomotsu Hirasaka]] is the name of the slope that leads to the [[Wikipedia:Yomi|underworld]] in Japanese mythology.\n* In the anime, this was the first jutsu used on [[Geography|Earth]].<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 460</ref>\n* [[Obito Uchiha]] was able to synchronise his [[Kamui]] with Kaguya's Yomotsu Hirasaka to gain access to her six dimensions.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 685, pages 3-8</ref>\n* [[Black Zetsu]] was able to use this technique while residing inside the sleeve of Kaguya's severed arm.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 689, page 11</ref>\n* At times, [[Urashiki Ōtsutsuki]] activates his [[Rinnegan]] before using this technique, though he can also use it without doing so.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 55</ref><ref>''Boruto'' episode 57</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* ''[[Ōtsutsuki Teleportation]]''\n* [[Kamui]]\n* ''[[Sasuke Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]''\n* ''[[Shin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu]]''\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[Category:Kekkei Mōra]]\n[[Clan::Ōtsutsuki Clan| ]]\n\n[[it:Ponte dell'Oltretomba]]\n[[fr:Yomotsu Hirasaka]]\n[[pt-br:Yomotsu Hirasaka]]\n[[pl:Yomotsu Hirasaka]]"
