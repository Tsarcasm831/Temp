As she swings the fan,<ref name=\"d2\"/> which has previously been smeared with her blood,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 214</ref> she [[Summoning Technique|summons]] [[Kamatari]], which travels upon the winds and rapidly cuts through everything in its path. The debris that Kamatari creates, as well as anything else in the area, is picked up by the winds and crushes whatever it is flung against. Because of how extensive this technique's damage and how wide an area it covers, it is most useful against hiding opponents or when the user is surrounded. The terrain is left flattened afterwards, which also means the user's location is exposed.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The reading of the name of this technique is a Japanese expression that means \"whirling; going round and round; rushing a person off his feet\".\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:Invocation - Danse du Faucheur]]\n[[pt-br:Invocação: Dança da Decapitação Rápida]]\n[[pl:Kuchiyose: Kirikiri Mai]]"
