It is essentially a halved version of the [[Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms]], but seems to be no less effective. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through thirty-two [[chakra points]] of an opponent's [[chakra pathway system]]. This eliminates their ability to use [[chakra]] for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move.\n\nOnce someone is within range of her field of divination, Hinata assumes her Gentle Fist stance and begins to deliver her attack:\n* First, two consecutive strikes to make two.\n* Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.\n* Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.\n* Fourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.\n* Fifth, another sixteen consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of thirty-two.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the ''[[Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles]]'' spin-off, [[Hanabi]] uses this technique.\n\n[[es:Ocho Trigramas Treinta y Dos Palmas]]\n[[pt-br:Oito Trigramas Trinta e Duas Palmas]]\n[[pl:Hakke Sanjūni Shō]]"
