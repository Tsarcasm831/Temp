The user of this technique is able to sound exactly like and use any technique that the original could. The user is also able to use this technique even when inside the opponents body.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* This technique resembles how Ginyū from ''[[wikipedia:Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Ball Z]]'' switched minds with Gokū. It even further resembles this because of the similar hand seals and the reason the user switched back to their original body."
