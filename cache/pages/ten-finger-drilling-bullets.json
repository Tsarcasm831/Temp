In volleys (five per hand), he shoots these bone bullets at a target by swinging his hand,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 215</ref> causing a loud sound as they're fired. The bullets travel incredibly quickly through the air and take a spinning motion. Upon impact, the bullets tear through skin, flesh, and bone.<ref name=\"d2\"/> The bullets aren't able to penetrate the [[Shield of Sand]],<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 213</ref> but in the anime, they can pierce [[samurai]] armour.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 307</ref> Kimimaro relies on this technique for his long-range attacks.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* The first two kanji (十指) would normally be pronounced as {{Translation|''jisshi''|じっし}} or {{Translation|''jusshi''|じゅっし}}, rather than the {{Translation|''teshi''|てし}} given by the furigana. ''Teshi'' probably comes from {{translation|''shushi''|手指|finger}}, the first kanji of which can also be pronounced as \"''te''\".\n* This is Kimimaro's only Shikotsumyaku technique that is not referred to as a dance.\n* In video games, such as ''[[Ultimate Ninja Storm]]'', Kimimaro uses these bullets as his main projectile instead of the [[shuriken]] used by most characters.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[All-Killing Ash Bones]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[fr:10 Phalanges Perforantes]]\n[[pl:Teshi Sendan]]\n[[pt-br:Dez Dedos Perfurantes]]"
