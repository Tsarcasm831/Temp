In the case of the [[toad]]s, the contract is a scroll that the summoner signs their name to using their own blood and further marks with the fingerprints of one of their hands.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 92, page 18</ref> [[Orochimaru]] has the [[snake]]s' contract tattooed to his arms, which he smears with blood each time he wants to perform a summoning.<ref name=\"c165\">''Naruto'' chapter 165, pages 18-19</ref> A user can summon different species provided they have signed the respective contracts, as [[Sasuke Uchiha]] is able to summon snakes and [[hawk]]s<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 477, page 9</ref> while [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]] can summon toads and monkeys.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 119</ref> Contracts remain active even after death, allowing those revived with the [[Impure World Reincarnation]] to perform summons they established when they were alive.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 530, page 14</ref>\n\nTo actually summon an animal, users apply some of their blood to the hand they signed the contract with. Usually they bite one of their fingers to accomplish this, but blood from injuries elsewhere on their body can also be used. They press the hands' five fingers down and channel chakra to the hand, summoning the animal to that location.<ref name=\"Fan\">''[[Hyō no Sho]]'', page 163</ref> While usually pressing them at the ground, it is also possible to do so on no surface at all, such as midair. The amount of chakra gathered in the hand determines the size and number of animals that are summoned: if too little chakra is offered, only a small, young animal will be summoned;<ref name=\"c165\"/> by offering large amounts of chakra, multiple adult animals can be summoned simultaneously.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 430, pages 2-3</ref> Two people who have signed the same contract can pool their chakra to summon especially large animals.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 650, page 6</ref> If an individual has access to the blood of someone who has signed an animal's contract, they can use the blood to summon the animal; the individual will need to provide their own chakra, however.<ref name=\"c363\">''Naruto'' chapter 363</ref>\n\nAnimals are typically summoned in order to lend assistance to their summoner, either by carrying out tasks or joining them in combat. Summoners will sometimes use their summons as a base for other [[jutsu]], as with [[Summoning: Food Cart Destroyer Technique]] and [[Summoning: Quick Beheading Dance]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 124, pages 9-11</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 214, pages 15-17</ref> Summoned animals are not actually required to do anything and may choose instead to harm their summoner; [[Manda]] routinely threatens to kill his summoners.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 171, page 2</ref> Animals can even refuse their summoner's attempt to summon them by sending another of their species in their place.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 634, page 1</ref> Animals are not summoned indefinitely and will return to wherever they were summoned from when they tire out and/or enough time has passed.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 642, page 8</ref> Summoners can take advantage of this by riding along when their summon returns home, granting them a quick means of escaping an area.<ref name=\"c363\"/>\n\nHaving the [[Rinnegan]] allows the user to circumvent several of the Summoning Technique's normal limitations. Using the [[Animal Path]], Rinnegan users can [[Summoning Rinnegan|summon]] dozens of different animals (and even [[Konan|people]]) without the need for blood. It is only with the Rinnegan that the [[Demonic Statue of the Outer Path]] can be summoned, whose actions are directly controlled by the Rinnegan user.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 606, pages 12-14</ref> [[Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki]] — the originator of the Rinnegan — is able to summon five people and the nine [[tailed beast]]s from [[Kaguya's Dimension]]s,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 690, pages 14-17</ref> though he needs the chakra of seventeen dead [[Kage]] to do so.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 686, page 1</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to summon naturally occurring, non-sentient phenomena. Koji Kashin has summoned the flames from the {{translation|Flaming Mountains|火焔山|Kaenzan}} in battle, as their non-chakra origin prevents them from being absorbed.<ref>''Boruto'' chapter 46</ref>\n\n== Known Summoning Domains ==\n* [[Mount Myōboku]] (Toads)\n* [[Ryūchi Cave]] (Snakes)\n* [[Shikkotsu Forest]] (Slugs)\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|\"Kuchiyose\"|[[Wiktionary:口寄せ|口寄せ]]|lit meaning=drawing in to speak}} refers to the practice of allowing spirits to [[wikipedia:Mediumship|possess one's body and speak through it]].\n* A {{translation|technique formulae|術式|jutsushiki}} is produced at the hand's location when a summoning is performed. Like with [[seal]]s, these formulae are a random assortment of [[wikipedia:Kanji|Kanji]], [[wikipedia:Hindi script|Hindi script]], and other symbols.\n* Animals can summon those who have signed contracts with them using the [[Reverse Summoning Technique]].<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 409, page 9</ref>\n* [[Kurama]] can apparently identify who is trying to summon it,<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 561, page 11</ref> something other summons have not been able to do.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 96, pages 4-5</ref> Similarly, any person who has summoned Kurama must continually provide their own chakra in order to keep it under their control.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 502 page 13-17</ref>\n* In the anime, [[Shiromari]] is summoned for a fifty year period because of a scroll left by its summoner before they died. When the scroll was destroyed, Shiromari was finally able to return home.<ref>''Naruto'' episode 194</ref>\n* In the ''Naruto: Shippūden'' anime, attempting to summon an animal without first signing a contract teleports the user to the home of the animal they have a natural affinity for.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 127</ref> In the ''Boruto'' anime, attempting to do this simply results in failure.<ref>''Boruto'' episode 4</ref>\n* In the anime, when the [[Ajisai|Animal Path]] performed the Summoning Technique onto [[Ibiki Morino]]'s abdomen, it caused him tremendous pain as the [[Giant Drill-Beaked Bird]] burst forth from his backside.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 160</ref>\n* In the anime, Summoning animals were in high demand for shinobi that researchers on the [[Summoning Island]] committed to research to enhance these animals, before creating the [[Ultimate Summoning Beast]] that turned on them all.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 227</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* {{Drilldown|List of summons|Characters|q=Classification=Summon}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[da:Kuchiyose no Jutsu]]\n[[de:Kuchiyose no Jutsu]]\n[[es:Jutsu de Invocación]]\n[[fr:Invocation]]\n[[he:ג'וטסו זימון]]\n[[id:Teknik Memanggil]]\n[[it:Tecnica del Richiamo]]\n[[ka:გამოძახების ტექნიკა]]\n[[lt:Iškvietimo technika]]\n[[pl:Kuchiyose no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica de Invocação]]\n[[ro:Tehnica de Invocare]]\n[[ru:Техника Призыва]]\n[[tr:Çağırma Tekniği]]\n[[uk:Хисло приклику]]\n[[vi:Thuật Triệu Hồi]]"
