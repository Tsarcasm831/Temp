They will then unleash a large barrage of water bullets. The bullets are very potent, able to effortlessly demolish large and sturdy trees.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In ''[[Naruto Mobile]]'', this technique is the basis for all of Moegi's attacks.

When hitting an enemy, an effect similar to [[Nose Water Tree]] occurs.\n\n[[fr:Suiton - Grêlons d'Eau]]\n[[pl:Suiton: Mizu Arare]]\n[[pt-br:Liberação de Água: Saudação d'Água]]"
