Because of how many shuriken there are and how many directions they're thrown from, the target, regardless of how skilled they may be, cannot reasonably dodge all of them.<ref name=\"d2\"/> As such, their only real option is to try and shield themselves to minimise the damage.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 134</ref> This focus on the shuriken inevitably creates blind-spots in the target, which is the actual purpose of this technique: the many Narutos can focus on these blind-spots to execute [[Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo|additional attack]]s.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* {{translation|\"Four directions, eight directions\"|四方八方|Shihōhappō}} is an idiom meaning \"from everywhere\", \"in all directions\". The four directions are the cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. The eight directions are these four and their halfway points: North-East, South-East, South-West, and North-West.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[es:Shuriken de Todas las Direcciones]]\n[[fr:Tourbillon de Shuriken des Quatre Points Cardinaux]]\n[[pl:Shihōhappō Shuriken]]\n[[pt-br:Shuriken pra Todo Lado]]"
