To perform, it requires a full intensive care unit, staffed by [[medic]]s with refined [[chakra]] control. The procedure lasts many hours, requiring the constant attention of the medics on staff and,<ref name=\"d2\"/> inevitably, requiring backup shifts to replace medics who have tired out.<ref name=\"c235\">''Naruto'' chapter 235</ref> Because of how difficult the procedure is, there is a very low chance of actually saving the patient.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nThe patient is placed in the centre of the floor. A large, complicated technique formula is drawn around them, focused around the injury to be healed.<ref name=\"c235\"/> A sample of the patient's cells, such as a lock of their hair, is placed near the injury, to be used as a medium for the procedure. Medics take position around the formula's perimeter, notably the corners, and work together to change the medium's cellular makeup, converting it into whatever cells are required for mending the wound. This is where the technique's greatest difficulty lies, as medics must be careful to form the correct cell and then just as carefully apply it to the regenerating injury.<ref name=\"d2\"/>\n\nIn the anime, [[Sakura Haruno]] is shown using this technique by herself; she needs neither the large formula nor the medium. Instead, four formula-lines are used to restore the missing section of the body. The technique is still very chakra-taxing, as Sakura fainted after using almost all of her chakra during the operation.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 395</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Jutsu Curativo de Reanimación y Regeneración]]\n[[fr:Technique de Guérison Réanimation Régénération]]\n[[pl:Chikatsu Saisei no Jutsu]]\n[[pt-br:Técnica da Cura Regenerativa]]"
