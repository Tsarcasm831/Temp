After using themselves as the perimeter for the barrier, a barrier is erected and then takes on a dome shape capable of even trapping the [[Nue]]. To ensure Konoha's ability to respond to a crisis, Naruto routinely trains Konoha shinobi to use the barrier, usually releasing his own powerful chakra to test their limit.\n\nThe barrier apparently does not prevent people from entering as the [[Seventh Hokage]] was able to enter it without any issues. Similarly a [[Spaceâ€“Time Ninjutsu]] was able to reach the barrier."
