It was utilised by the [[Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation|reincarnated]] [[Sound Four]] releasing their hatred within their [[Sound Four's Cursed Seals|cursed seals]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe seal activates around the user, trapping anyone within its range. The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier. [[Sensor]] ninja and even the [[Byakugan]] cannot sense and see through this technique respectively. The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops. To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra. [[Inoichi Yamanaka]] likens this to a [[genjutsu cancel]].\n\nInside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know. Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end. As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die. However, it sacrifices the lives of the users so the targets can be trapped and the users' malice is not blocked by the barrier so a ninja who can [[Negative Emotions Sensing|sense ill will]] can locate the barrier and break it, freeing the souls trapped within, while the users' disappears.\n\n[[es:Jutsu de Intercambio de Almas del Infierno]]\n[[pt-br:Fórmula da Técnica de Espaço-Tempo: Virada do Submundo]]\n[[pl:Jikūjutsu Shiki: Yomi Tenshin]]"
