[[Ameyuri]] heads in for an attack, delivering an [[Lightning Release|electricity]]-enhanced horizontal slash with [[Kiba (swords)|Kiba]], followed by [[Kisame]] slashing with [[Samehada]] in the opposite direction. [[Jinin]] launches the opponent up in the air with the axe portion of [[Kabutowari]], where they are met by [[Jinpachi]]'s attack wih [[Shibuki]], creating an explosion. From a distance, [[Mangetsu]] slashes the opponent with [[Hiramekarei]]'s longsword form, and [[Kushimaru]] stabs them repeatedly, binding them in place with [[Wire Strings|wire]]. Finally, [[Zabuza]] lands a final slash with [[Kubikiribōchō]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Kisame Hoshigaki replaces [[Fuguki Suikazan]] as [[Samehada]]'s wielder, despite not being of the same generation as the other six swordsmen."
