After absorbing her opponent's chakra, she could steal their soul. This technique could also be used to determine what elemental affinities the target has by licking them. Due to one body being unable to handle so much chakra, Fūka distributes the chakra she absorbed into multiple bodies, and uses [[Colour Course Change]] to switch to another if needed.\n\nWhen she tried using this against [[Naruto Uzumaki]] however, she began absorbing the chakra of the [[Nine-Tails]], but the pure rage and malice in its chakra proved too much for her that she stopped the technique.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In the [[wikipedia:Disney XD|Disney XD]] edited version, instead of licking the victim, Fūka smelled her opponents to determine their nature.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Beso Mortal]]\n[[fr:Baiser d'Exécution]]\n[[pl:Shikei Seppun]]"
