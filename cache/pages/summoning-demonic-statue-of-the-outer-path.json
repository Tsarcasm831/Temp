The statue's mouth then emitted [[chakra]] in the form of a dragon capable of extracting the chakra of anything it touched, killing humans immediately. After serving its purpose, the statue disappeared while the receivers broke off and remained embedded in Nagato's back.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 447, pages 7-13</ref>\n\n== Influences ==\n* As with many of Nagato's techniques, it is influenced by Buddhist terminology. {{translation|''Gedō''|外道|lit meaning=Outer Path}}, derived from the Sanskrit ''[[Wikipedia:Tirthika|Tīrthika]]'', refers to any doctrine which \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the {{translation|''Naidō''|内道|lit meaning=Inner Path}}, and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Both [[Obito]] and [[Madara]] were able to summon the statue without any adverse effects, instead utilising an offering of blood. When they use this technique, they refer to it simply as \"[[Summoning Technique]]\".<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 536, pages 15-17</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 659, pages 3-4</ref>\n* In ''[[Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]'', Obito summons the Demonic Statue which then launches bolts of chakra at the opponent.\n* In the anime, when unconsciously summoned by Nagato, the statue didn't drain his life force.<ref>''Naruto: Shippūden'' episode 347</ref>\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Invocación: Estatua Demoníaca del Camino Exterior]]\n[[fr:Invocation - Statue du Grand Démon Hérésiarque]]\n[[ka:ვიძახებ: გარეთა გზის დემონურ ქანდაკებას]]\n[[pt-br:Invocação: Estátua Demoníaca do Caminho Exterior]]\n[[ru:Кучиёсе: Гедо Мазо]]\n[[pl:Kuchiyose: Gedō Mazō]]"
