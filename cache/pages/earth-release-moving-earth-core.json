The size of the affected area as well as the depths that it is lowered or raised to is also up to the user. With precise timing, this technique can be used to evade incoming attacks, as well as to endanger opponents by moving them into the path of an oncoming attack reducing their reaction time as well as knocking them off balance, making it even harder to avoid the attack. Other than being moved below or above ground — relative to the surrounding surface — the terrain is not altered as plant life and people retain their same positions when this technique is used.<ref>''Naruto'' chapter 517, pages 12-16</ref><ref>''Naruto'' chapter 518, pages 3-4</ref>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Despite the name being read as {{Translation|chidōkaku|ちどうかく|}}, Ittan can be heard saying ''chidō'''g'''aku'' in episode 262.\n\n== Reference ==\n<references/>\n\n[[es:Elemento Tierra: Movimientos Tectónicos]]\n[[fr:Doton - Noyau de Rotation Terrestre]]\n[[pl:Doton: Chidōkaku]]\n[[pt-br:Estilo Terra: Movimentação do Núcleo da Terra]]"
